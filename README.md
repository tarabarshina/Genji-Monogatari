# Overview

This project is a structured text version of “The Tale of Genji” and a simple script library to handle it, based on the following sites.

- Eiichi Shibuya's [The World of The Tale of Genji](http://www.sainet.or.jp/~eshibuya/index.html) 
- Miyawaki Fuminori's [The World of The Tale of Genji, Re-edited Edition](http://www.genji-monogatari.net/) 

By distributing The Tale of Genji, one of Japan's most popular literary classics, in an easy-to-use computer format, I hope that this great work of content will enrich the Internet.
