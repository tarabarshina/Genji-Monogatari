## About this site

Have you ever tried reading The Tale of Genji?
There are many modern translations of the Tale of Genji by various authors, but have you ever wondered about the original text or other translations when you read your favorite translation?

This website was created in the hope that people will be able to read The Tale of Genji, one of Japan's most popular literary classics, while comparing the text and the translation.
I have created this website using works whose copyrights have expired or whose authors have kindly allowed us to handle them freely.

I am happy if more people can also enjoy the Tale of Genji by comparing it with their favorite Tale of Genji translation at hand.

### Modified parts

- About Seidensticker's translation:
	- The original text has line breaks in the middle of the text, which have been removed. Also, if there was a hyphen in the middle of a word to break the line, it was removed. (e.g. 'sud- denly' --> 'suddenly') 
	- In other parts of the text, the indentation and word order of the original text are also retained, but in some cases, lines are separated between the ground text and the dialogue in order to give priority to mapping with line numbers.
	- Mapping to line numbers is done manually, so if you find any errors, please let me know.

## Upcoming updates

- Addition of Seidensticker translation
- Addition of images, annotations, etc. that are not already there
- Under consideration, as the search index is too large for the current version to search well in MkDocs full-text search.
