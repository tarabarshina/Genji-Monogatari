25,1,1,1,25010101, Genji was famous and life was secure and peaceful. His ladies had in their several ways made their own lives and were happy.
25,1,1,2,25010102," There was an exception, Tamakazura, who faced a new crisis and was wondering what to do next. She was not as genuinely frightened of him, of course, as she had been of the Higo man; but since few people could possibly know what had happened, she must keep her disquiet to herself, and her growing sense of isolation."
25,1,1,3,25010103," Old enough to know a little of the world, she saw more than ever what a handicap it was not to have a mother."
25,1,1,4,25010104,"    Genji had made his confession. The result was that his longing increased. Fearful of being overheard, however, he found the subject a difficult one to approach, even gingerly. His visits were very frequent. Choosing times when she was likely to have few people with her, he would hint at his feelings, and she would be in an agony of embarrassment. Since she was not in a position to turn him away, she could only pretend that she did not know what was happening."
25,1,1,5,25010105,"    She was of a cheerful, affectionate disposition. Though she was also of a cautious and conservative nature, the chief impression she gave was of a delicate, winsome girlishness."
25,1,2,1,25010201,    Prince Hotaru continued to pay energetic court. His labors had not yet gone on for very long when he had the early-summer rains to be resentful of.
25,1,2,2,25010202,"    ""Admit me a little nearer, please,""  he wrote. ""I will feel better if I can unburden myself of even part of what is in my heart."""
25,1,2,3,25010203,    Genji saw the letter.
25,1,2,4,25010204," ""Princes,""  he said, ""should be listened to. Aloofness is not permitted. You must let him have an occasional answer."""
25,1,2,5,25010205,"  He even told her what to say.
    But he only made things worse. She said that she was not feeling well and did not answer."
25,1,2,6,25010206,"    There were few really highborn women in her household. She did have a cousin called Saisho~, daughter of a maternal uncle who had held a seat on the council. Genji had heard that she had been having a difficult time since her father's death, and had put her in Tamakazura's service. She wrote a passable hand and seemed generally capable and well informed. He assigned her the task of composing replies to gentlemen who deserved them. It was she whom he summoned today."
25,1,2,7,25010207, One may imagine that he was curious to see all of his brother's letters.
25,1,2,8,25010208," Tamakazura herself had been reading them with more interest since that shocking evening. It must not be thought that she had fallen in love with Hotaru, but he did seem to offer a way of evading Genji. She was learning rapidly."
25,1,2,9,25010209,"    Unaware that Genji himself was eagerly awaiting him, Hotaru was delighted at what seemed a positive invitation and quietly came calling."
25,1,2,10,25010210," A seat was put out for him near the corner doors, where she received him with only a curtain between them."
25,1,2,11,25010211," Genji had given close attention to the incense, which was mysterious and seductive--rather more attention, indeed, than a guardian might have felt that his duty demanded. One had to admire the results, whatever the motive. Saisho~ was at a loss to reply to Hotaru's overtures. Genji pinched her gently to remind her that her mistress must not behave like an unfeeling lump, and only added to her discomfiture."
25,1,3,1,25010301," The dark nights of the new moon were over and there was a bland quarter-moon in the cloudy sky. Calm and dignified, the prince was very handsome indeed. Genji's own very special perfume mixed with the incense that drifted through the room as people moved about."
25,1,3,2,25010302," More interesting than he would have expected, thought the prince. In calm control of himself all the while (and in pleasant contrast to certain other people), he made his avowals."
25,1,3,3,25010303,    Tamakazura withdrew to the east penthouse and lay down. Genji followed Saisho~ as she brought a new message from the prince.
25,1,3,4,25010304,"    ""You are not being kind,""  he said to Tamakazura. ""A person should behave as the occasion demands. You are unnecessarily coy. You should not be sending a messenger back and forth over such distances. If you do not wish him to hear your voice, very well, but at least you should move a little nearer."""
25,1,3,5,25010305,"    She was in despair. She suspected that his real motive was to impose himself upon her, and each course open to her seemed worse than all the others. She slipped away and lay down at a curtain between the penthouse and the main hall."
25,1,4,1,25010401,"    She was sunk in thought, unable to answer the prince's outpourings. Genji came up beside her and lifted the curtain back over its frame. There was a flash of light. She looked up startled. Had someone lighted a torch?"
25,1,4,2,25010402," No--Genji had earlier in the evening put a large number of fireflies in a cloth bag. * Now, letting no one guess what he was about, he released them."
25,1,4,3,25010403, Tamakazura brought a fan to her face. Her profile was very beautiful.
25,1,4,4,25010404,"    Genji had worked everything out very carefully. Prince Hotaru+ was certain to look in her direction. He was making a show of passion, Genji suspected, because he thought her Genji's daughter, and not because he had guessed what a beauty she was. Now he would see, and be genuinely excited."
25,1,4,5,25010405, Genji would not have gone to such trouble if she had in fact been his daughter. It all seems rather perverse of him.
25,1,4,6,25010406,    He slipped out through another door and returned to his part of the house.
25,1,5,1,25010501,"    The prince had guessed where the lady would be. Now he sensed that she was perhaps a little nearer. His heart racing, he looked through an opening in the rich gossamer curtains. Suddenly, some six or seven feet away, there was a flash of light--and such beauty as was revealed in it!"
25,1,5,2,25010502," Darkness was quickly restored, but the brief glimpse he had had was the sort of thing that makes for romance. The figure at the curtains may have been indistinct but it most certainly was slim and tall and graceful. Genji would not have been disappointed at the interest it had inspired."
25,1,5,3,25010503,"          ""You put out this silent fire to no avail.<br>          Can you extinguish the fire in the human heart?"
25,1,5,4,25010504,"    ""I hope I make myself understood."""
25,1,5,5,25010505,    Speed was the important thing in answering such a poem.
25,1,5,6,25010506,"          ""The firefly but burns and makes no comment.<br>          Silence sometimes tells of deeper thoughts."""
25,1,5,7,25010507,"    It was a brisk sort of reply, and having made it, she was gone. His lament about this chilly treatment was rather wordy,"
25,1,5,8,25010508," but he would not have wished to overdo it by staying the night. It was late when he braved the dripping eaves (and tears as well) and went out. I have no doubt that a cuckoo sent him on his way, but did not trouble myself to learn all the detd ls."
25,1,5,9,25010509,"    So handsome, so poised, said the women--so very much like Genji. Not knowing their lady's secret, they were filled with gratitude for Genji's attentions. Why, not even her mother could have done more for her."
25,1,6,1,25010601,
25,1,6,2,25010602,"    Unwelcome attentions, the lady was thinking. If she had been recognized by her father and her situation were nearer the ordinary, then they need not be entirely unwelcome. She had had wretched luck, and she lived in dread of rumors."
25,1,6,3,25010603,
25,1,6,4,25010604,"   Genji too was determined to avoid rumors. Yet he continued to have his ways. Can one really be sure, for instance, that he no longer had designs upon Akikonomu? There was something different about his manner When he was with her, something especially charming and seductive. But she was beyond the reach of direct overtures. Tamakazura was a modern sort of girl, and approachable. Sometimes dangerously near losing control of himself, he would do things which, had they been noticed, might have aroused suspicions. It was a difficult and complicated relationship indeed, and he must be given credit for the fact that he held back from the final line."
25,2,1,1,25020101,"    On the fifth day of the Fifth Month, the Day of the Iris, he stopped by her apartments on his way to the equestrian grounds."
25,2,1,2,25020102,"    ""What happened? Did he stay late? You must be careful with him. He is not to be trusted--not that there are very many men these days a girl really can trust."""
25,2,1,3,25020103,"    He praised his brother and blamed him. He seemed very young and was very handsome as he offered this word of caution. As for his clothes, the singlets and the robe thrown casually over them glowed in such rich and pleasing colors that they seemed to brim over and seek more space. One wondered whether a supernatural hand might not have had some part in the dyeing. The colors themselves were familiar enough, but the woven patterns were as if everything had pointed to this day of flowers.* The lady was sure she would have been quite intoxicated with the perfumes burned into them had she not had these worries."
25,2,1,4,25020104,"    A letter came from Prince Hotaru, on white tissue paper in a fine, aristocratic hand. At first sight the contents seemed very interesting, but somehow they became ordinary upon repeating."
25,2,1,5,25020105,"         ""Even today the iris is neglected.<br>       Its roots, my cries, are lost among the waters."" *"
25,2,1,6,25020106,"    It was attached to an iris root certain to be much talked of.
    ""You must get off an answer,"" said Genji, preparing to leave.
    Her women argued that she had no choice.
    Whatever she may have meant to suggest by it, this was her answer, a simple one set down in a faint, delicate hand:"
25,2,1,7,25020107,"         ""It might have flourished better in concealment,<br>           The iris root washed purposelessly away."
25,2,1,8,25020108,"    ""Exposure seems rather unwise."""
25,2,1,9,25020109,"    A connoisseur, the prince thought that the hand could just possibly be improved."
25,2,1,10,25020110,    Gifts of medicinal herbs in decorative packets+ came from this and that well-wisher. The festive brightness did much to make her forget earlier unhappiness and hope that she might come uninjured through this new trial.
25,2,2,1,25020201,"    Genji also called on the lady of the orange blossoms, in the east wing of the same northeast quarter."
25,2,2,2,25020202,"    ""Yu~giri is to bring some friends around after the archery meet. I should imagine it will still be daylight. I have never understood why our efforts to avoid attention always end in failure. The princes and the rest of them hear that something is up and come around to see, and so we have a much noisier party than we had planned on. We must in any event be ready."""
25,2,2,3,25020203,
25,2,2,4,25020204,    The equestrian stands were very near the galleries of the northeast quarter.
25,2,2,5,25020205,"    ""Come, girls,""  he said. ""Open all the doors and enjoy yourselves. Have a look at all the handsome officers. The ones in the Left Guards are especially handsome, several cuts above the common run at court."""
25,2,2,6,25020206,
25,2,2,7,25020207,"    They had a delightful time. Tamakazura joined them. There were fresh green blinds all along the galleries, and new curtains too, the rich colors at the hems fading, as is the fashion these days, to white above. Women and little girls clustered at all the doors. The girls in green# robes and trains of purple gossamer seemed to be from Tamakazura's wing."
25,2,2,8,25020208," There were four of them, all very pretty and well behaved. Her women too were in festive dress, trains blending from lavender at the waist down to deeper purple and formal jackets the color of carnation shoots."
25,2,2,9,25020209,"    The lady of the orange blossoms had her little girls in very dignified dress, singlets of deep pink and trains of red lined with green It was very amusing to see all the women striking new poses as they draped their finery about them."
25,2,2,10,25020210," The young courtiers noticed and seemed to be striking poses of their own.
    Genji went out to the stands toward midafternoon. All the princes were there, as he had predicted. The equestrian archery was freer and more varied than at the palace. The officers of the guard joined in, and everyone sat entranced through the afternoon."
25,2,2,11,25020211," The women may not have understood all the finer points, but the uniforms of even the common guardsmen were magnificent and the horsemanship was complicated and exciting."
25,2,2,12,25020212," The grounds were very wide, fronting also on Murasaki's southeast quarter, where young women were watching. There was music and dancing, Chinese polo music and the Korean dragon dance.* As night came on, the triumphal music rang out high and wild. The guardsmen were richly rewarded according to their several ranks. It was very late when the assembly dispersed."
25,2,3,1,25020301,    Genji spent the night with the lady of the orange blossoms.
25,2,3,2,25020302,"   ""Prince Hotaru is a man of parts,""  he said. ""He may not be the handsomest man in the world, but everything about him tells of breeding and cultivation, and he is excellent company. Did you chance to catch a glimpse of him? He has many good points, as I have said, but it may be that in the final analysis there is something just a bit lacking in him."""
25,2,3,3,25020303,
25,2,3,4,25020304,"    ""He is younger than you but I thought he looked older. I have heard that he never misses a chance to come calling. I saw him once long ago at court ans had not really seen him again until today. He has improved. Prince Sochi* is a very fine gentleman too, but somehow he does not quite look like royalty."""
25,2,3,5,25020305,    Genji smiled. Her judgment was quick and sure. But he kept his own counsel.
25,2,3,6,25020306, This sort of open appraisal of people still living was not to his taste.
25,2,3,7,25020307," He could not understand why the world had such a high opinion of Higekuro and would not have been pleased to receive him into the family,"
25,2,3,8,25020308, but these views too he kept to himself.
25,2,3,9,25020309,"    They were good friends, he and she, and no more, and they went to separate beds. Genji wondered when they had begun to drift apart. She never let fall the tiniest hint of jealousy. It had been the usual thing over the years for reports of such festivities to come to her through others. The events of the day seemed to bring new recognition to her and her household.
    She said softly:"
25,2,3,10,25020310,"         ""You honor the iris on the bank to which<br>         No pony comes to taste of withered grasses?"" +"
25,2,3,11,25020311,"    One could scarcely have called it a masterpiece, but he was touched."
25,2,3,12,25020312,"         ""This pony, like the love grebe, wants a comrade.<br>         Shall it forget the iris on the bank?"""
25,2,3,13,25020313,    Nor was his a very exciting poem.
25,2,3,14,25020314,"    ""I do not see as much of you as I would wish, but I do enjoy you."""
25,2,3,15,25020315," There was a certain irony in the words, from his bed to hers, but also affection. She was a dear, gentle lady."
25,2,3,16,25020316," She had let him have her bed and spread quilts for herself outside the curtains. She had in the course of time come to accept such arrangements as proper, and he did not suggest changing them."
25,3,1,1,25030101,"    The rains of earlyd ummer continued without a break, even gloomier than in most years. The ladies at Rokujo~ amused themselves with illustrated romances. The Akashi lady, a talented painter, sent pictures to her daughter."
25,3,1,2,25030102,"    Tamakazura was the most avid reader of all. She quite lost herself in pictures and stories and would spend whole days with them. Several of her young women were well informed in literary matters. She came upon all sorts of interesting and shocking incidents (she could not be sure whether they were true or not), but she found little that resembled her own unfortunate career."
25,3,1,3,25030103," There was _The Tale of Sumiyoshi_, popular in its day, of course, and still well thought of. She compared the plight of the heroine, within a hairbreadth of being taken by the chief accountant,* with her own escape from the Higo person."
25,3,1,4,25030104,    Genji could not help noticing the clutter of pictures and manuscripts.
25,3,1,5,25030105," ""What a nuisance this all is,""  he said one day. ""Women seem to have been born to be cheerfully deceived. They know perfectly well that in all these old stories there is scarcely a shred of truth, and yet they are captured and made sport of by the whole range of trivialities and go on scribbling them down, quite unaware that in these warm rains their hair is all dank and knotted."""
25,3,1,6,25030106,    He smiled.
25,3,1,7,25030107," ""What would we do if there were not these old romances to relieve our boredom? But amid all the fabrication I must admit that I do find real emotions and plausible chains of events. We can be quite aware of the frivolity and the idleness and still be moved. We have to feel a little sorry for a charming princess in the depths of gloom."
25,3,1,8,25030108," Sometimes a series of absurd and grotesque incidents which we know to be quite improbable holds our interest, and afterwards we must blush that it was so. Yet even then we can see what it was that held us."
25,3,1,9,25030109," Sometimes I stand and listen to the stories they read to my daughter, and I think to myself that there certainly are good talkers in the world. I think that these yarns must come from people much practiced in lying. But perhaps that is not the whole of the story?"""
25,3,1,10,25030110,    She pushed away her inkstone.
25,3,1,11,25030111," ""I can see that that would be the view of someone much given to lying himself. For my part, I am convinced of their truthfulness."""
25,3,1,12,25030112,
25,3,1,13,25030113,"    He laughed. ""I have been rude and unfair to your romances, haven't I. They have set down and preserved happenings from the age of the gods to our own. _The Chronicles of Japan and the rest are a mere fragment of the whole truth. It is your romances that fill in the details."
25,3,1,14,25030114,
25,3,2,1,25030201,"    ""We are not told of things that happened to specific people exactly as they happened; but the beginning is when there are good things and bad things, things that happen in this life which one never tires of seeing and hearing about, things which one cannot bear not to tell of and must pass on for all generations. If the storyteller wishes to speak well, then he chooses the good things; and if he wishes to hold the reader's attention he chooses bad things, extraordinarily bad things. Good things and bad things alike, they are things of this world and no other."
25,3,2,2,25030202,"    ""Writers in other countries approach the matter differently. Old stories in our own are different from new. There are differences in the degree of seriousness. But to dismiss them as lies is itself to depart from the truth."
25,3,2,3,25030203," Even in the writ which the Buddha drew from his noble heart are parables, devices for pointing obliquely at the truth. To the ignorant they may seem to operate at cross purposes. The Greater Vehicle is full of them, but the general burden is always the same. The difference between enlightenment and confusion is of about the same order as the difference between the good and the bad in a romance."
25,3,2,4,25030204," If one takes the generous view, then nothing is empty and useless."""
25,3,2,5,25030205,    He now seemed bent on establishing the uses of fiction.
25,3,2,6,25030206,"    ""But tell me: is there in any of your old stories a proper, upright fool like myself?""  He came closer. ""I doubt that even among the most unworldly of your heroines there is one who manages to be as distant and unnoticing as you are. Suppose the two of us set down our story and give the world a really interesting one."""
25,3,2,7,25030207,
25,3,2,8,25030208,"    ""I think it very likely that the world will take notice of our curious story even if we do not go to the trouble.""  She hid her face in her sleeves."
25,3,2,9,25030209,
25,3,2,10,25030210,"    ""Our curious story? Yes, incomparably curious, I should think."""
25,3,2,11,25030211,"  Smiling and playful, he pressed nearer."
25,3,2,12,25030212,"           ""Beside myself, I search through all the books,<br>           And come upon no daughter so unfilial."
25,3,2,13,25030213,"    ""You are breaking one of the commandments."""
25,3,2,14,25030214,"    He stroked her hair as he spoke, but she refused to look up. Presently, however, she managed a reply:"
25,3,2,15,25030215,"           ""So too it is with me. I too have searched,<br>           And found no cases quite so unparental."""
25,3,2,16,25030216,"    Somewhat chastened, he pursued the matter no further."
25,3,2,17,25030217, Yet one worried. What was to become of her?
25,3,3,1,25030301,    Murasaki too had become addicted to romances. Her excuse was that Genji's little daughter insisted on being read to.
25,3,3,2,25030302,"    ""Just see what a fine one this is,"""
25,3,3,3,25030303,"  she said, showing Genji an illustration for _The Tale of Kumano_. * The young girl in tranquil and confident slumber made her think of her own younger self."
25,3,3,4,25030304," ""How precocious even very little children seem to have been. I suppose I might have set myself up as a specimen of the slow, plodding variety. I would have won that competition easily."""
25,3,3,5,25030305,    Genji might have been the hero of some rather more eccentric stories.
25,3,3,6,25030306,"    ""You must not read love stories to her. I doubt that clandestine affairs would arouse her unduly, but we would not want her to think them commonplace."""
25,3,3,7,25030307,    What would Tamakazura have made of the difference between his remarks to her and these remarks to Murasaki?
25,3,3,8,25030308,
25,3,3,9,25030309,"    ""I would not of course offer the wanton ones as a model,""  replied Murasaki, ""but I would have doubts too about the other sort. Lady Ate-miya in _The Tale of the Hollow Tree_, for Instance. She is always very brisk and efficient and in control of things, and she never makes mistakes; but there is something unwomanly about her cool manner and clipped speech."""
25,3,3,10,25030310,
25,3,3,11,25030311,"    ""I should imagine that it is in real life as in fiction. We are all human and we all have our ways. It is not easy to be unerringly right. Proper, well-educated parents go to great trouble over a daughter's education and tell themselves that they have done well if something quiet and demure emerges. It seems a pity when defects come to light one after another and people start asking what her good parents can possibly have been up to."
25,3,3,12,25030312, Yet the rewards are very great when a girl's manner and behavior seem just right for her station. Even then empty praise is not satisfying. One knows that the girl is not perfect and looks at her more critically than before.
25,3,3,13,25030313," I would not wish my own daughter to be praised by people who have no standards."""
25,3,3,14,25030314,    He was genuinely concerned that she acquit herself well in the tests that lay before her.
25,3,3,15,25030315,"    Wicked stepmothers are of course standard fare for the romancers, and he did not want them poisoning relations between Murasaki and the child. He spent a great deal of time selecting romances he thought suitable, and ordered them copied and illustrated."
25,3,4,1,25030401,    He kept Yu~giri from Murasaki but encouraged him to be friends with the girl.
25,3,4,2,25030402," While he himself was alive it might not matter a great deal one way or the other, but if they were good friends now their affection was likely to deepen after he was dead."
25,3,4,3,25030403," He permitted Yu~giri inside the front room, though the inner rooms were forbidden. Having so few children, he had ample time for Yu~giri, who was a sober lad and seemed completely dependable."
25,3,4,4,25030404," The girl was still devoted to her dolls. They made Yu~giri think of his own childhood games with Kumoinokari. Sometimes as he waited in earnest attendance upon a doll princess, tears would come to his eyes."
25,3,4,5,25030405," He sometimes joked with ladies of a certain standing, but he was careful not to lead them too far. Even those who might have expected more had to make do with a joke. The thing that really concerned him and never left his mind was getting back at the nurse who had sneered at his blue sleeves."
25,3,4,6,25030406," He was fairly sure that he could better To~ no Chu~jo~ at a contest of wills, but sometimes the old anger and chagrin came back and he wanted more. He wanted to make To~ no Chu~jo~ genuinely regretful for what he had done. He revealed these feelings only to Kumoinokari. Before everyone else he was a model of cool composure."
25,3,4,7,25030407,"    Her brothers sometimes thought him rather conceited. Kashiwagi, the oldest, was greatly interested these days in Tamakazura. Lacking a better intermediary, he came sighing to Yu~giri. The friendship of the first generation was being repeated in the second."
25,3,4,8,25030408,"    ""One does not undertake to plead another's case,"""
25,3,4,9,25030409,  replied Yu~giri quietly.
25,3,5,1,25030501,"    To~ no Chu~jo~ was a very important man, and his many sons were embarked upon promising careers, as became their several pedigrees and inclinations. He had only two daughters. The one who had gone to court had been a disappointment. The prospect of having the other do poorly did not of course please him."
25,3,5,2,25030502," He had not forgotten the lady of the evening faces. He often spoke of her, and he went on wondering what had happened to the child."
25,3,5,3,25030503," The lady had put him off guard with her gentleness and appearance of helplessness, and so he had lost a daughter. A man must not under any circumstances let a woman out of his sight. Suppose the girl were to turn up now in some outlandish guise and stridently announce herself as his daughter--well, he would take her in."
25,3,5,4,25030504,
25,3,5,5,25030505,"    ""Do not dismiss anyone who says she is my daughter,""  he told his sons.  In my younger days I did many things I ought not to have done. There was a lady of not entirely contemptible birth who lost patience with me over some triviality or other, and so I lost a daughter, and I have so few."""
25,3,5,6,25030506,"    There had been a time when he had almost forgotten the lady. Then he began to see what great things his friends were doing for their daughters, and to feel resentful that he had been granted so few."
25,3,5,7,25030507,    One night he had a dream. He called in a famous seer and asked for an interpretation.
25,3,5,8,25030508,"    ""Might it be that you will hear of a long-lost child who has been taken in by someone else?"""
25,3,5,9,25030509,
25,3,5,10,25030510,    This was very puzzling. He could think of no daughters whom he had put out for adoption.
25,3,5,11,25030511, He began to wonder about Tamakazura.
