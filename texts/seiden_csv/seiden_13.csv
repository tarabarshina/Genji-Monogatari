13,1,1,1,13010101," The days went by and the thunder and rain continued. What was Genji to do? People would laugh if, in this extremity, out of favor at court, he were to return to the city. Should he then seek a mountain retreat? But if it were to be noised about that a storm had driven him away, then he would cut a ridiculous figure in history."
13,1,1,2,13010102,    His dreams were haunted by that same apparition. Messages from the city almost entirely ceased coming as the days went by without a break in the storms. Might he end his days at Suma? No one was likely to come calling in these tempests.
13,1,1,3,13010103,"    A messenger did come from Murasaki, a sad, sodden creature. Had they passed in the street, Genji would scarcely have known whether he was man or beast, and of course would not have thought of inviting him to come near. Now the man brought a surge of pleasure and affection--though Genji could not help asking himself whether the storm had weakened his moorings.
    Murasaki's letter, long and melancholy, said in part:"
13,1,1,4,13010104," ""The terrifying deluge goes on without a break, day after day. Even the skies are closed off, and I am denied the comfort of gazing in your direction."
13,1,1,5,13010105,"        ""What do they work, the sea winds down at Suma?<br>     At home, my sleeves are assaulted by wave after wave."""
13,1,1,6,13010106,    Tears so darkened Iris eyes that it was as if they were inviting the waters to rise higher.
13,1,1,7,13010107,"    The man said that the storms had been fierce in the city too, and that a special reading of the Prajn~a~pa~ramita~ Sutra had been ordered. ""Th sstreets are all closed and the great gentlemen can't get to court, and everything has closed down."""
13,1,1,8,13010108,"    The man spoke clumsily and haltingly, but he did bring news. Genji summoned him near and had him questioned."
13,1,1,9,13010109,"    ""It's not the way it usually is. You don't usually have rain going on for days without a break and the wind howling on and on. Everyone is terrified. But it's worse here. They haven't had this hail beating right through the ground and thunder going on and on and not letting a body think."""
13,1,1,10,13010110,  The terror written so plainly on his face did nothing to improve the spirits of the people at Suma.
13,1,2,1,13010201,    Might it be the end of the world? From dawn the next day the wind was so fierce and the tide so high and the surf so loud that it was as if the crags and the mountains must fall. The horror of the thunder and lightning was beyond description. Panic spread at each new flash.
13,1,2,2,13010202," For what sins, Genji's men asked, were they being punished? Were they to perish without another glimpse of their mothers and fathers, their dear wives and children?"
13,1,2,3,13010203,"    Genji tried to tell himself that he had been guilty of no misdeed for which he must perish here on the seashore. Such were the panic and confusion around him, however, that he bolstered his confidence with special offerings to the god of Sumiyoshi."
13,1,2,4,13010204,"    ""O you of Sumiyoshi who protect the lands about: if indeed you are an avatar of the Blessed One, then you must save us."""
13,1,2,5,13010205,"    His men were of course fearful for their lives; but the thought that so fine a gentleman (and in these deplorable circumstances) might be swept beneath the waters seemed altogether too tragic. The less distraught among them prayed in loud voices to this and that favored deity, Buddhist and Shinto, that their own lives be taken if it meant that his might be spared."
13,1,2,6,13010206,"    They faced Sumiyoshi and prayed and made vows: ""Our lord was reared deep in the fastnesses of the palace, and all blessings were his. You who, in the abundance of your mercy, have brought strength through these lands to all who have sunk beneath the weight of their troubles: in punishment for what crimes do you call forth these howling waves? Judge his case if you will, you gods of heaven and earth. Guiltless, he is accused of a crime, stripped of his offices, driven from his house and city, left as you see him with no relief from the torture and the lamentation. And now these horrors, and even his life seems threatened. Why? we must ask. Because of sins in some other life, because of crimes in this one? If your vision is clear, O you gods, then take all this away."""
13,1,2,7,13010207,
13,1,2,8,13010208,"    Genji offered prayers to the king of the sea and countless other gods as well. The thunder was increasingly more terrible, and finally the gallery adjoining his rooms was struck by lightning. Flames sprang up and the gallery was destroyed. The confusion was immense; the whole world seemed to have gone mad. Genji was moved to a building out in back, a kitchen or something of the sort it seemed to be. It was crowded with people of every station and rank. The clamor was almost enough to drown out the lightning and thunder. Night descended over a sky already as black as ink."
13,1,3,1,13010301,"    Presently the wind and rain subsided and stars began to come out. The kitchen being altogether too mean a place, a move back to the main hall was suggested."
13,1,3,2,13010302," The charred remains of the gallery were an ugly sight, however, and the hall had been badly muddied and all the blinds and curtains blown away."
13,1,3,3,13010303," Perhaps, Genji's men suggested somewhat tentatively, it might be better to wait until dawn."
13,1,3,4,13010304," Genji sought to concentrate upon the holy name, but his agitation continued to be very great."
13,1,3,5,13010305,"    He opened a wattled door and looked out. The moon had come up. The line left by the waves was white and dangerously near, and the surf was still high. There was no one here whom he could turn to, no student of the deeper truths who could discourse upon past and present and perhaps explain these wild events. All the fisherfolk had gathered at what they had heard was the house of a great gentleman from the city. They were as noisy and impossible to communicate with as a flock of birds, but no one thought of telling them to leave."
13,1,3,6,13010306,"    ""If the wind had kept up just a little longer,""  someone said, ""absolutely everything would have been swept under. The gods did well by us."""
13,1,3,7,13010307,"    There are no words--""lonely""  and ""forlorn""  seem much too weak--to describe his feelings."
13,1,3,8,13010308,"   ""Without the staying hand of the king of the sea<br>    The roar of the eight hundred waves would have taken us under."""
13,1,3,9,13010309,"    Genji was as exhausted as if all the buffets and fires of the tempest had been aimed at him personally. He dozed off, his head against some nondescript piece of furniture.
    The old emperor came to him, quite as when he had lived."
13,1,3,10,13010310," ""And why are you in this wretched place?"""
13,1,3,11,13010311,  He took Genji's hand and pulled him to his feet.
13,1,3,12,13010312," ""You must do as the god of Sumiyoshi tells you. You must put out to sea immediately. You must leave this shore behind."""
13,1,3,13,13010313,
13,1,3,14,13010314,"    ""Since I last saw you, sir,""  said Genji, overjoyed, ""I have suffered an unbroken series of misfortunes. I had thought of throwing myself into the sea."""
13,1,3,15,13010315,
13,1,3,16,13010316,"    ""That you must not do. You are undergoing brief punishment for certain sins. I myself did not commit any conscious crimes while I reigned, but a person is guilty of transgressions and oversights without his being aware of them. I am doing penance and have no time to look back towards this world. But an echo of your troubles came to me and I could not stand idle. I fought my way through the sea and up to this shore and I am very tired; but now that I am here I must see to a matter in the city."""
13,1,3,17,13010317,  And he disappeared.
13,1,3,18,13010318,"    Genji called after him, begging to be taken along. He looked around him. There was only the bright face of the moon. His father's presence had been too real for a dream, so real that he must still be here. Clouds traced sad lines across the sky."
13,1,3,19,13010319," It had been clear and palpable, the figure he had so longed to see even in a dream, so clear that he could almost catch an afterimage. His father had come through the skies to help him in what had seemed the last extremity of his sufferings. He was deeply grateful, even to the tempests; and in the aftermath of the dream he was happy."
13,1,3,20,13010320,"    Quite different emotions now ruffled his serenity. He forgot his immediate troubles and only regretted that his father had not stayed longer. Perhaps he would come again. Genji would have liked to go back to sleep, but he lay wakeful until daylight."
13,1,4,1,13010401,    A little boat had pulled in at the shore and two or three men came up.
13,1,4,2,13010402,"    ""The revered monk who was once governor of Harima has come from Akashi. If the former Minamoto councillor, Lord Yoshikiyo, is here, we wonder if we might trouble him to come down and hear the details of our mission."""
13,1,4,3,13010403,    Yoshikiyo pretended to be surprised and puzzled.
13,1,4,4,13010404," ""He was once among my closer acquaintances here in Harima, but we had a falling out and it has been same time since we last exchanged letters. What can have brought him through such seas in that little boat?"""
13,1,4,5,13010405,    Genji's dream had given intimations. He sent Yoshikiyo down to the boat immediately. Yoshikiyo marveled that it could even have been launched upon such a sea.
13,1,4,6,13010406,"    These were the details of the mission, from the mouth of the old governor: ""Early this month a strange figure came to me in a dream. I listened, though somewhat incredulously, and was told that on the thirteenth there would be a clear and present sign. I was to ready a boat and make for this shore when the waves subsided."
13,1,4,7,13010407," I did ready a boat, and then came this savage wind and lightning. I thought of numerous foreign sovereigns who have received instructions in dreams on how to save their lands, and I concluded that even at the risk of incurring his ridicule I must on the day appointed inform your lord of the import of the dream. And so I did indeed put out to sea. A strange jet blew all the way and brought us to this shore. I cannot think of it except as divine intervention. And might I ask whether there have been corresponding manifestations here? I do hate to trouble you, but might I ask you to communicate all of this to your lord?"""
13,1,4,8,13010408,
13,1,4,9,13010409,"    Yoshikiyo quietly relayed the message, which brought new considerations."
13,1,4,10,13010410," There had been these various unsettling signs conveyed to Genji dreaming and waking. The possibility of being laughed at for having departed these shores under threat now seemed the lesser risk. To turn his back on what might be a real offer of help from the gods would be to ask for still worse misfortunes. It was not easy to reject ordinary advice, and personal reservations counted for little when the advice came from great eminences. ""Defer to them; they will cause you no reproaches,""  a wise man of old once said.*"
13,1,4,11,13010411," He could scarcely face worse misfortunes by deferring than by not deferring, and he did not seem likely to gain great merit and profit by hesitating out of Concern for his brave name. Had not his own father come to him? What room was there for doubts?"
13,1,4,12,13010412,    He sent back his answer:
13,1,4,13,13010413," ""I have been through a great deal in this strange place, and I hear nothing at all from the city. I but gaze upon a sun and moon going I know not where as comrades from my old home; and now comes this angler's boat, happy tidings on an angry wind.+ Might there be a place along your Akashi coast where I can hide myself?"""
13,1,4,14,13010414,    The old man was delighted.
13,1,4,15,13010415, Genji's men pressed him to set out even before sunrise.
13,1,4,16,13010416," Taking along only four or five of his closest attendants, he boarded the boat."
13,1,4,17,13010417," That strange wind came up again and they were at Akashi as if they had flown. It was very near, within crawling distance, so to speak; but still the workings of the wind were strange and marvelous."
13,2,1,1,13020101,"    The Akashi coast was every bit as beautiful as he had been told it was. He would have preferred fewer people, but on the whole he was pleased. Along the coast and in the hills the old monk had put up numerous buildings with which to take advantage of the four seasons: a reed-roofed beach cottage with fine seasonal vistas; beside a mountain stream a chapel of some grandeur and dignity, suitable for rites and meditation and invocation of the holy name; and rows of storehouses where the harvest was put away and a bountiful life assured for the years that remained."
13,2,1,2,13020102," Fearful of the high tides, the old monk had sent his daughter and her women off to the hills. The house on the beach was at Genji's disposal."
13,2,1,3,13020103,"    The sun was rising as Genji left the boat and got into a carriage. This first look by daylight at his new guest brought a happy smile to the old man's lips. He felt as if the accumulated years were falling away and as if new years had been granted him. He gave silent thanks to the god of Sumiyoshi. He might have seemed ridiculous as he bustled around seeing to Genji's needs, as if the radiance of the sun and the moon had become his private property; but no one laughed at him."
13,2,1,4,13020104,"    I need not describe the beauty of the Akashi coast. The careful attention that had gone into the house and the rocks and plantings of the garden, the graceful line of the coast--it was infinitely pleasanter than Suma, and one would not have wished to ask a less than profoundly sensitive painter to paint it. The house was in quiet good taste. The old man's way of life was as Genji had heard it described, hardly more rustic than that of the grandees at court. In sheer luxury, indeed, he rather outdid them."
13,2,2,1,13020201,"    When Genji had rested for a time he got off messages to the city. He summoned Murasaki's messenger, who was still at Suma recovering from the horrors of his journey."
13,2,2,2,13020202,
13,2,2,3,13020203," Loaded with rewards for his services, he now set out again for the city. It would seem that Genji sent off a description of his perils to priests and others of whose services he regularly made use,*"
13,2,2,4,13020204, but he told only Fujitsubo how narrow his escape had in fact been. He repeatedly laid down his brush as he sought to answer that very affectionate letter from Murasaki.
13,2,2,5,13020205,"    ""I feel that I have run the whole gamut of horrors and then run it again, and more than ever I would like to renounce the world; but though everything else has fled away, the image which you entrusted to the mirror has not for an instant left me. I think that I might not see you again."
13,2,2,6,13020206,"         ""Yet farther away, upon the beach at Akashi,<br>          My thoughts of a distant city, and of you."
13,2,2,7,13020207,"    ""I am still half dazed, which fact will I fear be too apparent in the confusion and disorder of this letter."""
13,2,2,8,13020208,"    Though it was true that his letter was somewhat disordered, his men thought it splendid. How very fond he must be of their lady!"
13,2,2,9,13020209, It would seem that they sent off descriptions of their own perils.
13,2,2,10,13020210,"    The apparently interminable rains had at last stopped and the sky was bright far into the distance. The fishermen radiated good spirits. Suma had been a lonely place with only a few huts scattered among the rocks. It was true that the crowds here at Akashi were not entirely to Genji's liking, but it was a pleasant spot with much to interest him and take his mind from his troubles."
13,2,3,1,13020301,    The old man's devotion to the religious life was rather wonderful. Only one matter interfered with it: worry about his daughter. He told Genji a little of his concern for the girl. Genji was sympathetic.
13,2,3,2,13020302," He had heard that she was very handsome and wondered if there might not be some bond between them, that he should have come upon her in this strange place. But no; here he was in the remote provinces, and he must think of nothing but his own prayers. He would be unable to face Murasaki if he were to depart from the promises he had made her."
13,2,3,3,13020303, Yet he continued to be interested in the girl. Everything suggested that her nature and appearance were very far from ordinary.
13,2,3,4,13020304,"    Reluctant to intrude himself, the old man had moved to an outbuilding. He was restless and unhappy when away from Genji, however, and he prayed more fervently than ever to the gods and Buddhas that his unlikely hope might be realized."
13,2,3,5,13020305," Though in his sixties he had taken good care of himself and was young for his age. The religious life and the fact that he was of proud lineage may have had something to do with the matter. He was stubborn and intractable, as old people often are, but he was well versed in antiquities and not without a certain subtlety. His stories of old times did a great deal to dispel Genji's boredom."
13,2,3,6,13020306," Genji had been too busy himself for the sort of erudition, the lore about customs and precedents, which he now had in bits and installments, and he told himself that it would have been a great loss if he had not known Akashi and its venerable master."
13,2,3,7,13020307,"    In a sense they were friends, but Genji rather overawed the old man. Though he had seemed so confident when he told his wife of his hopes, he hesitated, unable to broach the matter, now that the time for action had come, and seemed capable only of bemoaning his weakness and inadequacy."
13,2,3,8,13020308," As for the daughter, she rarely saw a passable man here in the country among people of her own rank; and now she had had a glimpse of a man the like of whom she had not suspected to exist. She was a shy, modest girl, and she thought him quite beyond her reach. She had had hints of her father's ambitions and thought them wildly inappropriate, and her discomfort was greater for having Genji near."
13,2,4,1,13020401,"    It was the Fourth Month. The old man had all the curtains and fixtures of Genji's rooms changed for fresh summery ones. Genji was touched and a little embarrassed, feeling that the old man's attentions were perhaps a bit overdone; but he would not have wished for the world to offend so proud a nature."
13,2,4,2,13020402,"    A great many messages now came from the city inquiring after his safety. On a quiet moonlit night when the sea stretched off into the distance under a cloudless sky, he almost felt that he was looking at the familiar waters of his own garden. Overcome with longing, he was like a solitary, nameless wanderer."
13,2,4,3,13020403," ""Awaji, distant foam,"" * he whispered to himself."
13,2,4,4,13020404,"       ""Awaji: in your name is all my sadness,<br>     And clear you stand in the light of the moon tonight."""
13,2,4,5,13020405,"    He took out the seven-stringed koto, long neglected, which he had brought from the city and spread a train of sad thoughts through the house as he plucked out a few tentative notes."
13,2,4,6,13020406," He exhausted all his skills on ""The Wide Barrow,"" + and the sound reached the house in the hills on a sighing of wind and waves. Sensitive young ladies heard it and were moved. Lowly rustics, though they could not have identified the music, were lured out into the sea winds, there to catch cold."
13,2,5,1,13020501,"    The old man could not sit still. Casting aside his beads, he came running over to the main house."
13,2,5,2,13020502,"    ""I feel as if a world I had thrown away were coming back,""  he said, breathless and tearful. ""It is a night such as to make one feel that the blessed world for which one longs must be even so."""
13,2,5,3,13020503,
13,2,5,4,13020504,"    Genji played on in a reverie, a flood of memories of concerts over the years, of this gentleman and that lady on flute and koto, of voices raised in song, of times when he and they had been the center of attention, recipients of praise and favors from the emperor himself."
13,2,5,5,13020505," Sending to the house on the hill for a lute and a thirteen-stringed koto, the old man now seemed to change roles and become one of these priestly mendicants who make their living by the lute."
13,2,5,6,13020506," He played a most interesting and affecting strain. Genji played a few notes on the thirteen-stringed koto which the old man pressed on him and was thought an uncommonly impressive performer on both sorts of koto. Even the most ordinary music can seem remarkable if the time and place are right; and here on the wide seacoast, open far into the distance, the groves seemed to come alive in colors richer than the bloom of spring or the change of autumn, and the calls of the water rails were as if they were pounding on the door and demanding to be admitted."
13,2,5,7,13020507,    The old man had a delicate style to which the instruments were beautifully suited and which delighted Genji.
13,2,5,8,13020508," ""One likes to see a gentle lady quite at her ease with a koto,"""
13,2,5,9,13020509,"  said Genji, as if with nothing specific in mind.
     The old man smiled."
13,2,5,10,13020510," ""And where, sir, is one likely to find a gentler, more refined musician than yourself? On the koto I am in the third generation from the emperor Daigo. I have left the great world for the rustic surroundings in which you have found me, and sometimes when I have been more gloomy than usual I have taken out a koto and picked away at it; and, curiously, there has been someone who has imitated me. Her playing has come quite naturally to resemble my master's. Or perhaps it has only seemed so to the degenerate ear of the mountain monk who has only the pine winds for company. I wonder if it might be possible to let you hear a strain, in the greatest secrecy of course."""
13,2,5,11,13020511,  He brushed away a tear.
13,2,5,12,13020512,
13,2,5,13,13020513,"    ""I have been rash and impertinent. My playing must have sounded like no playing at all."""
13,2,5,14,13020514,  Genji turned away from the koto.
13,2,5,15,13020515," ""I do not know why, but it has always been the case that ladies have taken especially well to the koto. One hears that with her father to teach her the fifth daughter of the emperor Saga was a great master of the instrument, but it would seem that she had no successors. The people who set themselves up as masters these days are quite ordinary performers with no real grounding at all. How fascinating that someone who still holds to the grand style should be hidden away on this coast. Do let me hear her."""
13,2,5,16,13020516,
13,2,5,17,13020517,"    ""No difficulty at all, if that is what you wish. If you really wish it, I can summon her. There was once a poet, you will remember, who was much pleased at the lute of a tradesman's wife.* While we are on the subject of lutes, there were not many even in the old days who could bring out the best in the instrument. Yet it would seem that the person of whom I speak plays with a certain sureness and manages to affect a rather pleasing delicacy. I have no idea where she might have acquired these skills. It seems wrong that she should be asked to compete with the wild waves, but sometimes in my gloom I do have her strike up a tune."""
13,2,5,18,13020518,"    He spoke with such spirit that Genji, much interested, pushed the lute toward him."
13,2,5,19,13020519,"    He did indeed play beautifully, adding decorations that have gone out of fashion. There was a Chinese elegance in his touch, and he was able to induce a particularly solemn tremolo from the instrument. Though it might have been argued that the setting was wrong, an adept among his retainers was persuaded to sing for them about the clean shore of Ise.+ Tapping out the rhythm, Genji would join in from time to time, and the old man would pause to offer a word of praise. Refreshments were brought in, very prettily arranged. The old man was most assiduous in seeing that the cups were kept full, and it became the sort of evening when troubles are forgotten."
13,2,6,1,13020601,"    Late in the night the sea breezes were cool and the moon seemed brighter and clearer as it sank towards the west. All was quiet. In pieces and fragments the old man told about himself, from his feelings upon taking up residence on this Akashi coast to his hopes for the future life and the prospects which his devotions seemed to be opening. He added, unsolicited, an account of his daughter. Genji listened with interest and sympathy."
13,2,6,2,13020602,"    ""It is not easy for me to say it, sir, but the fact that you are here even briefly in what must be for you strange and quite unexpected surroundings, and the fact that you are being asked to undergo trials new to your experience--I wonder if it Might not be that the powers to whom an aged monk has so fervently prayed for so many years have taken pity on him."
13,2,6,3,13020603," It is now eighteen years since I first prayed and made vows to the god of Sumiyoshi.# I have had certain hopes for my daughter since she was very young, and every spring and autumn I have taken her to Sumiyoshi. At each of my six daily services, three of them in the daytime and three at night, I have put aside my own wishes for salvation and ventured a suggestion that my hopes for the girl be noticed."
13,2,6,4,13020604," I have sunk to this provincial obscurity because I brought an unhappy destiny with me into this life. My father was a minister, and you see what I have become. If my family is to follow the same road in the future, I ask myself, then where will it end? But I have had high hopes for her since she was born. I have been determined that she go to some noble gentleman in the city. I have been accused of arrogance and unworthy ambitions and subjected to some rather unpleasant treatment. I have not let it worry me. I have said to her that while I live I will do what I can for her, limited though my resources may be; and that if I die before my hopes are realized she is to throw herself into the sea."""
13,2,6,5,13020605,  He was weeping. It had taken great resolve for him to speak so openly.
13,2,6,6,13020606,    Genji wept easily these days.
13,2,6,7,13020607," ""I had been feeling put upon, bundled off to this strange place because of crimes I was not aware of having committed. Your story makes me feel that there is a bond between us. Why did you not tell me earlier? Nothing has seemed quite real since I came here, and I have given myself up to prayers to the exclusion of everything else, and so I fear that I will have struck you as spiritless. Though reports had reached me of the lady of whom you have spoken, I had feared that she would want to have nothing to do with an outcast like myself. You will be my guide and intermediary? May I look forward to company these lonely evenings?"""
13,2,6,8,13020608,    The old man was thoroughly delighted.
13,2,6,9,13020609,"    ""Do you too know the sadness of the nights<br>    On the shore of Akashi with only thoughts for companions?"
13,2,6,10,13020610,"    ""Imagine, if you will, how it has been for us through the long months and years."""
13,2,6,11,13020611," He faltered, though with no loss of dignity, and his voice was trembling."
13,2,6,12,13020612,"    ""But you, sir, are used to this seacoast."
13,2,6,13,13020613,"     ""The traveler passes fretful nights at Akashi.<br>    The grass which he reaps for his pillow reaps no dreams."""
13,2,6,14,13020614,"    His openness delighted the old man, who talked on and on--and became rather tiresome, I fear. In my impatience I may have allowed inaccuracies to creep in, and exaggerated his eccentricities."
13,2,7,1,13020701,"    In any event, he felt a clean happiness sweep over him. A beginning had been made.
    At about noon the next day Genji got off a note to the house on the hill. A real treasure might lie buried in this unlikely spot. He took a great deal of trouble with his note, which was on a fine saffron-colored Korean paper."
13,2,7,2,13020702,"      ""Do I catch, as I gaze into unresponsive skies,<br>    A glimpse of a grove of which I have had certain tidings?"
13,2,7,3,13020703,"    ""My resolve has been quite dissipated."" *"
13,2,7,4,13020704,    And was that all? one wonders.
13,2,7,5,13020705,"    The old man had been waiting. Genji's messenger came staggering back down the hill, for he had been hospitably received."
13,2,7,6,13020706,"    But the girl was taking time with her reply. The old man rushed to her rooms and urged haste, but to no avail. She thought her hand q unequal to the task, and awareness of the difference in their station dismayed her. She was not feeling well, she said, and lay down."
13,2,7,7,13020707,"    Though he would certainly have wished it otherwise, the old man finally answered in her place."
13,2,7,8,13020708," ""Her rustic sleeves are too narrow to encompass such awesome tidings, it would seem, and indeed she seems to have found herself incapable of even reading your letter."
13,2,7,9,13020709,"      ""She gazes into the skies into which you gaze.<br>     May they bring your thoughts and hers into some accord."
13,2,7,10,13020710,"    ""But I fear that I will seem impertinent and forward."""
13,2,7,11,13020711,"    It was in a most uncompromisingly old-fashioned hand, on sturdy Michinoku paper; but there was something spruce and dashing about it too. Yes, ""forward""  was the proper word. Indeed, Genji was rather startled. He gave the messenger a ""bejeweled apron,""  an appropriate gift, he thought, from a beach cottage.*"
13,2,7,12,13020712,"    He got off another message the next day,"
13,2,7,13,13020713," beautifully written on soft, delicate paper. ""I am not accustomed to receiving letters from ladies' secretaries."
13,2,7,14,13020714,"            ""Unwillingly reticent about my sorrows<br>          I still must be--for no one makes inquiry."
13,2,7,15,13020715,"    ""Though it is difficult to say just what I mean."""
13,2,7,16,13020716,"    There would have been something unnatural about a girl who refused to be interested in such a letter. She thought it splendid, but she also thought it impossibly out of her reach. Notice from such supreme heights had the perverse effect of reducing her to tears and inaction.
    She was finally badgered into setting something down. She chose delicately perfumed lavender paper and took great care with the gradations of her ink."
13,2,7,17,13020717,"       ""Unwillingly reticent--how can it be so?<br>       How can you sorrow for someone you have not met?"""
13,2,7,18,13020718,    The diction and the handwriting would have done credit to any of the fine ladies at court.
13,2,7,19,13020719," He fell into a deep reverie, for he was reminded of days back in the city. But he did not want to attract attention, and presently shook it off.
    Every other day or so, choosing times when he was not likely to be noticed, and when he imagined that her thoughts might be similar to his --a quiet, uneventful evening, a lonely dawn--he would get off a note to her."
13,2,7,20,13020720," There was a proud reserve in her answers which made him want more than ever to meet her. But there was Yoshikiyo to think of. He had spoken of the lady as if he thought her his property, and Genji did not wish to contravene these long-standing claims. If her parents persisted in offering her to him, he would make that fact his excuse, and seek to pursue the affair as quietly as possible. Not that she was making things easy for him. She seemed prouder and more aloof than the proudest lady at court; and so the days went by in a contest of wills."
13,2,7,21,13020721,"    The city was more than ever on his mind now that he had moved beyond the Suma barrier. He feared that not even in jest+ could he do without Murasaki. Again he was asking himself if he might not bring her quietly to Akashi, and he was on the point of doing just that. But he did not expect to be here very much longer, and nothing was to be gained by inviting criticism at this late date."
13,2,8,1,13020801,"    In the city it had been a year of omens and disturbances. On the thirteenth day of the Third Month, as the thunder and winds mounted to new fury, the emperor had a dream. His father stood glowering at the stairs to the royal bedchamber and had a great deal to say, all of it, apparently, about Genji. Deeply troubled, the emperor described the dream to his mother."
13,2,8,2,13020802,
13,2,8,3,13020803,"    ""On stormy nights a person has a way of dreaming about the things that are on his mind, "" she said."" If I were you I would not give it a second thought."""
13,2,8,4,13020804,
13,2,8,5,13020805,"    Perhaps because his eyes had met the angry eyes of his father, he came down with a very painful eye ailment. Retreat and fasting were ordered for the whole court, even Kokiden's household."
13,2,8,6,13020806," Then the minister, her father, died. He was of such years that his death need have surprised no one, but Kokiden too was unwell, and worse as the days went by; and the emperor had a great deal to worry about."
13,2,8,7,13020807," So long as an innocent Genji was off in the wilderness, he feared, he must suffer. He ventured from time to time a suggestion that Genji be restored to his old rank and offices."
13,2,8,8,13020808,
13,2,8,9,13020809,"    His mother sternly advised against it. ""People will tax you with shallowness and indecision. Can you really think of having a man go into exile and then bringing him back before the minimum three years have gone by?"""
13,2,8,10,13020810,"    And so he hesitated, and he and his mother were in increasingly poor health."
13,3,1,1,13030101,    At Akashi it was the season when cold winds blow from the sea to make a lonely bed even lonelier.
13,3,1,2,13030102,"    Genji sometimes spoke to the old man. ""If you were perhaps to bring her here when no one is looking?"""
13,3,1,3,13030103,    He thought that he could hardly be expected to visit her. She had her own ideas.
13,3,1,4,13030104," She knew that rustic maidens should come running at a word from a city gentleman who happened to be briefly in the vicinity. No, she did not belong to his world, and she would only be inviting grief if she pretended that she did."
13,3,1,5,13030105," Her parents had impossible hopes, it seemed, and were asking the unthinkable and building a future on nothing. What they were really doing was inviting endless trouble. It was good fortune enough to exchange notes with him for so long as he stayed on this shore. Her own prayers had been modest: that she be permitted a glimpse of the gentleman of whom she had heard so much. She had had her glimpse, from a distance, to be sure, and, brought in on the wind, she had also caught hints of his unmatched skill (of this too she had heard) on the koto. She had learned rather a great deal about him these past days, and she was satisfied. Indeed a nameless woman lost among the fishermen's huts had no right to expect even this."
13,3,1,6,13030106, She was acutely embarrassed at any suggestion that he be invited nearer.
13,3,1,7,13030107,    Her father too was uneasy. Now that his prayers were being answered he began to have thoughts of failure.
13,3,1,8,13030108," It would be very sad for the girl, offered heedlessly to Genji, to learn that he did not want her. "
13,3,1,9,13030109,
13,3,1,10,13030110,Rejection was painful at the hands of the finest gentleman. His unquestioning faith in all the invisible gods had perhaps led him to overlook human inclinations and probabilities.
13,3,1,11,13030111,
13,3,1,12,13030112,"    ""How pleasant,""  Genji kept saying, ""if I could hear that koto to the singing of the waves. It is the season for such things. We should not let it pass."""
13,3,1,13,13030113,
13,3,2,1,13030201,"    Dismissing his wife's reservations and saying nothing to his disciples, the old man selected an auspicious day. He bustled around making preparations, the results of which were dazzling. The moon was near full. He sent off a note which said only: ""This night that should not be wasted."" *"
13,3,2,2,13030202," It seemed a bit arch, but Genji changed to informal court dress and set forth late in the night. He had a carriage decked out most resplendently, and then, deciding that it might seem ostentatious, went on horseback instead. The lady's house was some distance back in the hills. The coast lay in full view below, the bay silver in the moonlight. He would have liked to show it to Murasaki. The temptation was strong to turn his horse,s head and gallop on to the city."
13,3,2,3,13030203,"    ""Race on through the moonlit sky, O roan-colored horse,<br>       And let me be briefly with her for whom I long."" *"
13,3,2,4,13030204,
13,3,2,5,13030205,"    The house was a fine one, set in a grove of trees. Careful attention had gone into all the details. In contrast to the solid dignity of the house on the beach, this house in the hills had a certain fragility about it, and he could imagine the melancholy thoughts that must come to one who lived here. There was sadness in the sound of the temple bells borne in on pine breezes from a hall of meditation nearby. Even the pines seemed to be asking for something as they sent their roots out over the crags. All manner of autumn insects were singing in the garden."
13,3,2,6,13030206, He looked about him and saw a pavilion finer than the others. The cypress door upon which the moonlight seemed to focus was slightly open.
13,3,2,7,13030207,"    He hesitated and then spoke. There was no answer. She had resolved to admit him no nearer. All very aristocratic, thought Genji. Even ladies so wellborn that they were sheltered from sudden visitors usually tried to make conversation when the visitor was Genji. Perhaps she was letting him know that he was under a cloud. He was annoyed and thought of leaving. It would run against the mood of things to force himself upon her, and on the other hand he would look rather silly if it were to seem that she had bested him at this contest of wills. One would indeed have wished to show him, the picture of dejection, ""to someone who knows."""
13,3,2,8,13030208,"    A curtain string brushed against a koto, to tell him that she had been passing a quiet evening at her music."
13,3,2,9,13030209,"    ""And will you not play for me on the koto of which I have heard so much?"
13,3,2,10,13030210,
13,3,2,11,13030211,"   ""Would there were someone with whom I might share my thoughts<br>   And so dispel some part of these sad dreams."""
13,3,2,12,13030212,"        ""You speak to one for whom the night has no end.<br>        How can she tell the dreaming from the waking?"""
13,3,2,13,13030213,"    The almost inaudible whisper reminded him strongly of the Rokujo~ lady.
    This lady had not been prepared for an incursion and could not cope with it. She fled to an inner room. How she could have contrived to bar it he could not tell, but it was very firmly barred indeed. Though he did not exactly force his way through, it is not to be imagined that he left matters as they were."
13,3,2,14,13030214," Delicate, slender--she was almost too beautiful. Pleasure was mingled with pity at the thought that he was imposing himself upon her. She was even more pleasing than reports from afar had had her. The autumn night, usually so long, was over in a trice. Not wishing to be seen, he hurried out, leaving affectionate assurances behind."
13,3,2,15,13030215,"    He got off an unobtrusive note later in the morning. Perhaps he was feeling twinges of conscience. The old monk was equally intent upon secrecy, and sorry that he was impelled to treat the messenger rather coolly."
13,3,2,16,13030216,"    Genji called in secret from time to time. The two houses being some distance apart, he feared being seen by fishermen, who were known to relish a good rumor, and sometimes several days would elapse between his visits. Exactly as she had expected, thought the girl. Her father, forgetting that enlightenment was his goal, quite gave his prayers over to silent queries as to when Genji might be expected to come again; and so (and it seems a pity) a tranquillity very laboriously attained was disturbed at a very late date."
13,3,3,1,13030301,"    Genji dreaded having Murasaki learn of the affair. He still loved her more than anyone, and he did not want her to make even joking reference to it. She was a quiet, docile lady, but she had more than once been unhappy with him. Why, for the sake of brief pleasure, had he caused her pain? He wished it were all his to do over again. The sight of the Akashi lady only brought new longing for the other lady.
    He got off a more earnest and affectionate letter than usual, at the end of which he said:"
13,3,3,2,13030302," ""I am in anguish at the thought that, because of foolish occurrences for which I have been responsible but have had little heart, I might appear in a guise distasteful to you. There has been a strange, fleeting encounter. That I should volunteer this story will make you see, I hope, how little I wish to have secrets from you. Let the gods be my judges."
13,3,3,3,13030303,
13,3,3,4,13030304,"    ""It was but the fisherman's brush with the salty sea pine<br>       Followed by a tide of tears of longing."""
13,3,3,5,13030305,"    Her reply was gentle and unreproachful, and at the end of it she said:"
13,3,3,6,13030306," ""That you should have deigned to tell me a dreamlike story which you could not keep to yourself calls to mind numbers of earlier instances."
13,3,3,7,13030307,"    ""$$ Naive of me, perhaps; yet we did make our vows.<br>    And now see the waves that wash the Mountain of Waiting!"" *"
13,3,3,8,13030308,"    It was the one note of reproach in a quiet, undemanding letter. He found it hard to put down, and for some nights he stayed away from the house in the hills."
13,3,4,1,13030401,    The Akashi lady was convinced once more that her fears had become actuality. Now seemed the time to throw herself into the sea.
13,3,4,2,13030402," She had only her parents to turn to and they were very old. She had had no ambitions for herself, no thought of making a respectable marriage. Yet the years had gone by happily enough, without storms or tears. Now she saw that the world can be very cruel."
13,3,4,3,13030403," She managed to conceal her worries, however, and to do nothing that might annoy Genji. He was more and more pleased with her as time went by."
13,3,4,4,13030404,"    But there was the other, the lady in the city, waiting and waiting for his return. He did not want to do anything that would make her unhappy, and he spent his nights alone."
13,3,4,5,13030405," He sent sketchbooks off to her, adding poems calculated to provoke replies. No doubt her women were delighted with them; and when the sorrow was too much for her (and as if by thought transference) she too would make sketches and set down notes which came to resemble a journal.
    And what did the future have in store for the two of them?"
13,4,1,1,13040101,"    The New Year came, the emperor was ill, and a pall settled over Court life. There was a son, by Lady Sho~kyo~den, daughter of the Minister of the Right,* but the child was only two, far too young for the throne. The obvious course was to abdicate in favor of the crown prince. As the emperor turned over in his mind the problem of advice and counsel for his successor, he thought it more than ever a pity that Genji should be off in the provinces. Finally he went against Kokiden's injunctions and issued an amnesty."
13,4,1,2,13040102," Kokiden had been ill from the previous year, the victim of a malign spirit, it seemed, and numerous other dire omens had disturbed the court. Though the emperor's eye ailment had for a time improved, perhaps because of strict fasting, it was worse again. Late in the Seventh Month, in deep despondency, he issued a second order, summoning Genji back to the city."
13,4,1,3,13040103,"    Genji had been sure that a pardon would presently come, but he also knew that life is uncertain. That it should come so soon was of course pleasing. At the same time the thought of leaving this Akashi coast filled him with regret. The old monk, though granting that it was most proper and just, was upset at the news. He managed all the same to tell himself that Genji's prosperity was in his own best interest."
13,4,2,1,13040201," Genji visited the lady every night and sought to console her. From about the Sixth Month she had shown symptoms such as to make their relations more complex. A sad, ironical affair seemed at the same time to come to a climax and to disintegrate. He wondered at the perverseness of fates that seemed always to be bringing new surprises."
13,4,2,2,13040202," The lady, and one could scarcely have blamed her, was sunk in the deepest gloom. Genji had set forth on a strange, dark journey with a comforting certainty that he would one day return to the city;"
13,4,2,3,13040203, and he now lamented that he would not see this Akashi again.
13,4,2,4,13040204,"    His men, in their several ways, were delighted. An escort came from the city, there was a joyous stir of preparation, and the master of the house was lost in tears. So the month came to an end."
13,4,2,5,13040205," It was a season for sadness in any case, and sad thoughts accosted Genji. Why, now and long ago, had he abandoned himself, heedlessly but of his own accord, to random, profitless affairs of the heart?"
13,4,2,6,13040206,"    ""What a great deal of trouble he does cause,""  said those who knew the secret."
13,4,2,7,13040207,
13,4,2,8,13040208," ""The same thing all over again. For almost a year he didn't tell anyone and he didn't seem to care the first thing about her."
13,4,2,9,13040209," And now just when he ought to be letting well enough alone he makes things worse."""
13,4,2,10,13040210,    Yoshikiyo was the uncomfortable one. He knew what his fellows were saying: that he had talked too much and started it all.
13,4,3,1,13040301,"    Two days before his departure Genji visited his lady, setting out earlier than usual. This first really careful look at her revealed an astonishingly proud beauty. He comforted her with promises that he would choose an opportune time to bring her to the city."
13,4,3,2,13040302," I shall not comment again upon his own good looks. He was thinner from fasting, and emaciation seemed to add the final touches to the picture. He made tearful vows. The lady replied in her heart that this small measure of affection was all she wanted and deserved, and that his radiance only emphasized her own dullness. The waves moaned in the autumn winds, the smoke from the salt burners' fires drew faint lines across the sky, and all the symbols of loneliness seemed to gather together."
13,4,3,3,13040303,"    ""Even though we now must part for a time,<br>    The smoke from these briny fires will follow me."""
13,4,3,4,13040304,
13,4,3,5,13040305,"    ""Smoldering thoughts like the sea grass burned on these shores.<br>    And what good now to ask for anything more?"""
13,4,3,6,13040306,"    She fell silent, weeping softly, and a rather conventional poem seemed to say a great deal.
    She had not, through it all, played for him on the koto of which he had heard so much."
13,4,3,7,13040307,"    ""Do let me hear it. Let it be a memento."""
13,4,3,8,13040308,"    Sending for the seven-stringed koto he had brought from the city, he played an unusual strain, quiet but wonderfully clear on the midnight air."
13,4,3,9,13040309," Unable to restrain himself, the old man pushed a thirteen-stringed koto toward his daughter. She was apparently in a mood for music. Softly she tuned the instrument, and her touch suggested very great polish and elegance. He had thought Fujitsubo's playing quite incomparable. It was in the modern style, and enough to bring cries of wonder from anyone who knew a little about music. For him it was like Fujitsubo herself, the essence of all her delicate awareness."
13,4,3,10,13040310," The koto of the lady before him was quiet and calm, and so rich in overtones as almost to arouse envy. She left off playing just as the connoisseur who was her listener had passed the first stages of surprise and become eager attention. Disappointment and regret succeeded pleasure. He had been here for nearly a year. Why had he not insisted that she play for him, time after time? All he could do now was repeat the old vows."
13,4,3,11,13040311,"    ""Take this koto,""  he said, ""to remember me by. Someday we will play together."""
13,4,3,12,13040312,    Her reply was soft and almost casual:
13,4,3,13,13040313,"        ""One heedless word, one koto, to set me at rest.<br>     In the sound of it the sound of my weeping, forever."""
13,4,3,14,13040314,    He could not let it pass.
13,4,3,15,13040315,"        ""Do not change the middle string* of this koto.<br>           Unchanging I shall be till we meet again."
13,4,3,16,13040316,"    ""And we will meet again before it has slipped out of tune."""
13,4,3,17,13040317,    Yet it was not unnatural that the parting should seem more real than the reunion.
13,4,4,1,13040401,"    On the last morning Genji was up and ready before daybreak. Though he had little time to himself in all the stir, he contrived to write to her:"
13,4,4,2,13040402,"          ""Sad the retreating waves at leaving this shore.<br>          Sad I am for you, remaining after."""
13,4,4,3,13040403,
13,4,4,4,13040404,"          ""You leave, my reed-roofed hut will fall to ruin.<br>          Would that I might go out with these waves."""
13,4,4,5,13040405,"    It was an honest poem, and in spite of himself he was weeping."
13,4,4,6,13040406," One could, after all, become fond of a hostile place, said those who did not know the secret."
13,4,4,7,13040407,
13,4,4,8,13040408," Those who did, Yoshikiyo and others, were a little jealous, concluding that it must have been a rather successful affair."
13,4,4,9,13040409,"    There were tears, for all the joy; but I shall not dwell upon them."
13,4,4,10,13040410,"    The old man had arranged the grandest of farewell ceremonies. He had splendid travel robes for everyone, even the lowliest footmen. One marveled that he had found time to collect them all. The gifts for Genji himself were of course the finest, chests and chests of them, borne by a retinue which he attached to Genji's. Some of them would make very suitable gifts in the city. He had overlooked nothing.
    The lady had pinned a poem to a travel robe:"
13,4,4,11,13040411,"        ""I made it for you, but the surging brine has wet it.<br>          And might you find it unpleasant and cast it off?"""
13,4,4,12,13040412,"    Despite the confusion, he sent one of his own robes in return, and with it a note:
    ""It was very thoughtful of you."
13,4,4,13,13040413,"        ""Take it, this middle robe, let it be the symbol<br>        Of days uncounted but few between now and then."""
13,4,4,14,13040414,"    Something else, no doubt, to put in her chest of memories. It was a fine robe and it bore a most remarkable fragrance. How could it fail to move her?"
13,4,4,15,13040415,
13,4,4,16,13040416,"    The old monk, his face like one of the twisted shells on the beach, was meanwhile making some of the younger people smile. ""I have quite renounced the world,"" he said, ""but the thought that I may not see you back to the city--"
13,4,4,17,13040417,
13,4,4,18,13040418,"          ""Though weary of life, seasoned by salty winds,
          I am not able to leave this shore behind, and I wander lost in thoughts upon my child.*"
13,4,4,19,13040419, Do let me see you at least as far as the border.
13,4,4,20,13040420," It may seem forward of me, but if something should from time to time call up thoughts of her, do please let her hear from you."""
13,4,4,21,13040421,
13,4,4,22,13040422,"    ""It is an impossibility, sir, for very particular reasons, that I can ever forget her. You will very quickly be made to see my real intentions. If I seem dispirited, it is only because I am sad to leave all this behind."
13,4,4,23,13040423,"  ""I wept upon leaving the city in the spring.
        I weep in the autumn on leaving this home by the sea."
13,4,4,24,13040424,"    ""What else can I do?""  And he brushed away a tear.
    The old man seemed on the point of expiring."
13,4,5,1,13040501,"    The lady did not want anyone to guess the intensity of her grief, but it was there, and with it sorrow at the lowly rank (she knew that she could not complain) that had made this parting inevitable. His image remained before her, and she seemed capable only of weeping.
    Her mother tried everything to console her."
13,4,5,2,13040502," ""What could we have been thinking of? You have such odd ideas,""  she said to her husband, ""and I should have been more careful."""
13,4,5,3,13040503,
13,4,5,4,13040504,"    ""Enough, enough. There are reasons why he cannot abandon her. I have no doubt that he has already made his plans. Stop worrying, mix yourself a dose of something or other. This wailing will do no good."""
13,4,5,5,13040505,"  But he was sitting disconsolate in a corner.
    The women of the house, the mother and the nurse and the rest, went on charging him with unreasonable methods."
13,4,5,6,13040506," ""We had hoped and prayed over the years that she might have the sort of life any girl wants, and things finally seemed to be going well--and now see what has happened."""
13,4,5,7,13040507,"    It was true. Old age suddenly advanced and subdued him, and he spent his days in bed. But when night came he was up and alert.
    ""What can have happened to my beads?""
    Unable to find them, he brought empty hands together in supplication."
13,4,5,8,13040508," His disciples giggled. They giggled again when he set forth on a moonlight peregrination and managed to fall into the brook and bruise his hip on one of the garden stones he had chosen so carefully. For a time pain drove away, or at least obscured, his worries."
13,5,1,1,13050101,    Genji went through lustration ceremonies at Naniwa and sent a messenger to Sumiyoshi with thanks that he had come thus far and a promise to visit at a later date in fulfillment of his vows. His retinue had grown to an army and did not permit side excursions. He made his way directly back to the city.
13,5,1,2,13050102, At Nijo~ the reunion was like a dream. Tears of joy flowed so freely as almost to seem inauspicious.
13,5,1,3,13050103," Murasaki, for whom life had come to seem of as little value as her farewell poem had suggested it to be, shared in the joy. She had matured and was more beautiful than ever. Her hair had been almost too rich and thick. Worry and sorrow had thinned it somewhat and thereby improved it. And now, thought Genji, a deep peace coming over him, they would be together. And in that instant there came to him the image of the one whom he had not been ready to leave. It seemed that his life must go on being complicated."
13,5,1,4,13050104,"    He told Murasaki about the other lady. A pensive, dreamy look passed over his face, and she whispered, as if to dismiss the matter: ""For myself I do not worry.""*
    He smiled. It was a charmingly gentle reproof. Unable to take his eyes from her now that he had her before him, he could not think how he had survived so many months and years without her. All the old bitterness came back."
13,5,1,5,13050105, He was restored to his former rank and made a supernumerary councillor. All his followers were similarly rehabilitated. It was as if spring had come to a withered tree.
13,5,2,1,13050201,"    The emperor summoned him and as they made their formal greetings thought how exile had improved him. Courtiers looked on with curiosity, wondering what the years in the provinces would have done to him. For the elderly women who had been in service since the reign of his late father, regret gave way to noisy rejoicing."
13,5,2,2,13050202," The emperor had felt rather shy at the prospect of receiving Genji and had taken great pains with his dress. He seemed pale and sickly, though he had felt somewhat better these last few days. They talked fondly of this and that, and presently it was night."
13,5,2,3,13050203, A full moon flooded the tranquil scene. There were tears in the emperor's eyes.
13,5,2,4,13050204,"    ""We have not had music here of late,""  he said, ""and it has been a very long time since I last heard any of the old songs."""
13,5,2,5,13050205,    Genji replied:
13,5,2,6,13050206,"          ""Cast out upon the sea, I passed the years<br>         As useless as the leech child of the gods."" *"
13,5,2,7,13050207,    The emperor was touched and embarrassed.
13,5,2,8,13050208,"          ""The leech child's parents met beyond the pillar.<br>          We meet again to forget the spring of parting."""
13,5,2,9,13050209,    He was a man of delicate grace and charm.
13,5,2,10,13050210,"    Genji's first task was to commission a grand reading of the Lotus Sutra in his father's memory. He called on the crown prince, who had grown in his absence, and was touched that the boy should be so pleased to see him. He had done so well with his studies that there need be no misgivings about his competence to rule."
13,5,2,11,13050211," It would seem that Genji also called on Fujitsubo, and managed to control himself sufficiently for a quiet and affectionate conversation."
13,5,3,1,13050301,"    I had forgotten: he sent a note with the retinue which, like a returning wave, returned to Akashi. Very tender, it had been composed when no one was watching."
13,5,3,2,13050302,"    ""And how is it with you these nights when the waves roll in?"
13,5,3,3,13050303,"    ""I wonder, do the morning mists yet rise,<br>            There at Akashi of the lonely nights?"""
13,5,3,4,13050304,"    The Kyushu Gosechi dancer had had fond thoughts of the exiled Genji, and she was vaguely disappointed to learn that he was back in the city and once more in the emperor's good graces. She sent a note, with instructions that the messenger was to say nothing of its origin:"
13,5,3,5,13050305,"        ""There once came tidings from a boat at Suma,<br>        From one who now might show you sodden sleeves."""
13,5,3,6,13050306,"    Her hand had improved, though not enough to keep him from guessing whose it was."
13,5,3,7,13050307,"    ""It is I, not you, from whom the complaints should come.<br>     My sleeves have refused to dry since last you wrote."""
13,5,3,8,13050308,"    He had not seen enough of her, and her letter brought fond memories. But he was not going to embark upon new adventures."
13,5,3,9,13050309,"    To the lady of the orange blossoms he sent only a note, cause more for disappointment than for pleasure."
