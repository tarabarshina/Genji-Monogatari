3,1,1,1,03010101," Genji lay sleepless.<br>     ""I am not used to such treatment. Tonight I have for the first time seen how a woman can treat a man. The shock and the shame are such that I do not know how I can go on living.""<br>    The boy was in tears, which made him even more charming. The slight form, the not too long hair--was it Genji's imagination that he was much like his sister? The resemblance was very affecting, even if imagined. It would be undignified to make an issue of the matter and seek the woman out, and so Genji passed the night in puzzled resentment. The boy found him less friendly than usual.<br>    Genji left before daylight. Very sad, thought the boy, lonely without him."
3,1,1,2,03010102,"    The lady too passed a difficult night. There was no further word from Genji. It seemed that he had had enough of her. She would not be happy if he had in fact given her up, but with half her mind she dreaded another visit. It would be as well to have an end of the affair. Yet she went on grieving."
3,1,1,3,03010103,"    For Genji there was gnawing dissatisfaction. He could not forget her, and he feared he was making a fool of himself.<br>     ""I am in a sad state,""  he said to the boy. ""I try to forget her, and I cannot. Do you suppose you might contrive another meeting?""<br>    It would be difficult, but the boy was delighted even at this sort of attention."
3,1,2,1,03010201," With childish eagerness he watched for an opportunity. Presently the governor of Kii had to go off to his province. The lady had nothing to do through the long twilight hours. Under cover of darkness, the boy took Genji to the governor's mansion in his own carriage. "
3,1,2,2,03010202," Genji had certain misgivings. His guide was after all a mere child. But this was no time for hesitation. Dressed inconspicuously, he urged the boy on, lest they arrive after the gates were barred."
3,1,2,3,03010203," The carriage was brought in through a back gate and Genji dismounted.<br>    So young a boy attracted little attention and indeed little deference from the guards."
3,1,2,4,03010204, He left Genji at an east door to the main hall. He pounded on the south shutters and went inside.
3,1,2,5,03010205,"     ""Shut it, shut it!""  shrieked the women. ""The whole world can see us."""
3,1,2,6,03010206,"     ""But why do you have them closed on such a warm evening?"""
3,1,2,7,03010207,"     ""The lady from the west wing has been here since noon. They have been at Go."""
3,1,2,8,03010208,"    Hoping to see them at the Go board, Genji slipped from his hiding place and made his way through the door and the blinds."
3,1,2,9,03010209," The shutter through which the boy had gone was still raised.* Genji could see through to the west. One panel of a screen just inside had been folded back, and the curtains, which should have shielded off the space beyond, had been thrown over their frames, perhaps because of the heat. The view was unobstructed."
3,1,3,1,03010301,"    There was a lamp near the women. The one in silhouette with her back against a pillar--would she be the one on whom his heart was set? He looked first at her. She seemed to have on a purple singlet with a woven pattern, and over it a cloak of which the color and material were not easy to determine. She was a small, rather ordinary lady with delicate features. She evidently wanted to conceal her face even from the girl opposite, and she kept her thin little hands tucked in her sleeves."
3,1,3,2,03010302," Her opponent was facing east, and Genji had a full view of her face. Over a singlet of white gossamer she had thrown a purplish cloak, and both garments were somewhat carelessly open all the way to the band of the red trousers. She was very handsome, tall and plump and of a fair complexion, and the lines of her head and forehead were strong and pleasing. It was a sunny face, with a beguiling cheerfulness about the eyes and mouth. Though not particularly long, the hair was rich and thick, and very beautiful where it fell about the shoulders."
3,1,3,3,03010303," He could detect no marked flaws, and saw why her father, the governor of Iyo, so cherished her. It might help, to be sure, if she were just a little quieter. Yet she did not seem to be merely silly. She brimmed with good spirits as she placed a stone upon a dead spot to signal the end of the game."
3,1,3,4,03010304,"     ""Just a minute, if you please,""  said the other very calmly.  ""It is not quite over. You will see that we have a ko~ to get out of the way first."" +"
3,1,3,5,03010305,"     ""I've lost, I've lost. Let's just see what I have in the corners.""  She counted up on her fingers. ""Ten, twenty, thirty, forty.""  She would have had no trouble, he thought, taking the full count of the baths of Iyo*-- though her manner might have been just a touch inelegant."
3,1,3,6,03010306,"    The other woman, a model of demureness, kept her face hidden. Gazing at her, Genji was able to make out the details of the profile. The eyelids seemed a trifle swollen, the lines of the nose were somewhat erratic, and there was a weariness, a want of luster, about the face. It was, one had to admit, a little on the plain side. Yet she clearly paid attention to her appearance, and there were details likely to draw the eye to a subtler sensibility than was evident in her lively companion."
3,1,3,7,03010307," The latter, very engaging indeed, laughed ever more happily. There was no denying the bright gaiety, and in her way she was interesting enough. A shallow, superficial thing, no doubt, but to his less than pure heart she seemed a prize not to be flung away."
3,1,3,8,03010308," All the ladies he knew were so prim and proper. This was the first time he had seen one so completely at her ease. He felt a little guilty, but not so guilty that he would have turned away had he not heard the boy coming back. He slipped outside."
3,1,3,9,03010309,"    Apologetic that his master should still be at the beginning,"
3,1,3,10,03010310, the boy said that the unexpected guest had interfered with his plans.
3,1,3,11,03010311,"     ""You mean to send me off frustrated once more? It is really too much."""
3,1,3,12,03010312,"     ""No, sir. But I must ask you to wait until the other lady has gone. I'll arrange everything then, I promise you."""
3,1,3,13,03010313,"    Things seemed to be arranging themselves. The boy was very young, but he was calmly self-possessed and had a good eye for the significant things."
3,1,3,14,03010314,"    The game of Go was apparently over. There was a stir inside, and a sound as of withdrawing."
3,1,3,15,03010315,"     ""Where will that boy have gone?""  Now there was a banging of shutters. ""Let's get the place closed up."""
3,1,3,16,03010316,"     ""No one seems to be stirring,""  said Genji after a time. ""Go and do your best."""
3,1,3,17,03010317,    The boy knew well enough that it was not his sister's nature to encourage frivolity. He must admit Genji when there was almost no one with her.
3,1,3,18,03010318,"     ""Is the guest still here?""  asked Genji.  ""I would like a glimpse of her."""
3,1,3,19,03010319,"     ""Quite impossible. There are curtains inside the shutters."""
3,1,3,20,03010320,"    Genji was amused, but thought it would be bad manners to let the boy know that he had already seen the lady. ""How slowly time does go by."""
3,1,3,21,03010321,    This time the boy knocked on the corner door and was admitted.
3,1,3,22,03010322,"     ""I'll just make myself comfortable here, "" he said, spreading bedclothes where one or two of the sliding doors had been left open. ""Come in, breezes.""<br>    Numbers of older women seemed to be sleeping out near the veranda. The girl who had opened the door seemed to have joined them. The boy feigned sleep for a time. Then, spreading a screen to block the light, he motioned Genji inside."
3,1,3,23,03010323,"    Genji was suddenly shy, fearing he would be defeated once more. He followed the boy all the same. Raising a curtain, he slipped into the main room. It was very quiet, and his robes rustled alarmingly."
3,1,4,1,03010401,"    With one part of her mind the woman was pleased that he had not given up. But the nightmare of the earlier evening had not left her. Brooding days, sleepless nights--it was summer, and yet it was  ""budless spring."" *<br>    Her companion at Go, meanwhile, was as cheerful as could be. ""I shall stay with you tonight,"" she announced."
3,1,4,2,03010402," It was not likely that she would have trouble sleeping.<br>    The lady herself sensed that something was amiss. Detecting an unusual perfume, she raised her head. It was dark where the curtain had been thrown over the frame, but she could see a form creeping toward her. In a panic, she got up. Pulling a singlet of raw silk over her shoulders, she slipped from the room."
3,1,4,3,03010403,"    Genji was delighted to see that there was only one lady asleep behind the curtains. There seemed to be two people asleep out toward the veranda. As he pulled aside the bedclothes it seemed to him that the lady was somewhat larger than he would have expected. He became aware of one odd detail after another in the sleeping figure, and guessed what had happened. How very stupid! And how ridiculous he would seem if the sleeper were to awaken and see that she was the victim of a silly mistake. It would be equally silly to pursue the lady he had come for, now that she had made her feelings so clear. A new thought came to him: might this be the girl who had so interested him in the lamplight? If so, what had he to lose? It will be observed that a certain fickleness was at work."
3,1,4,4,03010404,"    The girl was now awake, and very surprised. Genji felt a little sorry for her. But though inexperienced in the ways of love, she was bright and modern, and she had not entirely lost her composure. He was at first reluctant to identify himself. She would presently guess, however, and what did it matter if she did? As for the unfriendly one who had ned him and who was so concerned about appearances--he did have to think of her reputation, and so he said to the girl that he had taken advantage of directional taboos to visit her. A more experienced lady would have had no trouble guessing the truth, but this one did not sense that his explanation was a little forced."
3,1,4,5,03010405," He was not displeased with her, nor was he strongly drawn to her. His heart was resentfully on the other. No doubt she would be off in some hidden chamber gloating over her victory. She had shown a most extraordinary firmness of purpose. In a curious way, her hostility made her memorable. The girl beside him had a certain young charm of her own, and presently he was deep in vows of love."
3,1,4,6,03010406,"     ""The ancients used to say that a secret love runs deeper than an open one.""  He was most persuasive. ""Think well of me. I must worry about appearances, and it is not as if I could go where my desires take me. And you: there are people who would not at all approve. That is sad. But you must not forget me."""
3,1,4,7,03010407,"     ""I'm afraid.""  Clearly she was afraid. ""I won't be able to write to you."""
3,1,4,8,03010408,"     ""You are right that we would not want people to know. But there is the little man I brought with me tonight. We can exchange notes through him. Meanwhile you must behave as if nothing had happened."" "
3,1,4,9,03010409, He took as a keepsake a summer robe the other lady seemed to have thrown off.
3,1,4,10,03010410,"    The boy was sleeping nearby. The adventure was on his mind, however, and Genji had no trouble arousing him. As he opened the door an elderly serving woman called out in surprise."
3,1,4,11,03010411,    Who s there?
3,1,4,12,03010412,
3,1,4,13,03010413,"     ""Just me,""  replied the boy in some confusion."
3,1,4,14,03010414,"     ""Wherever are you going at this time of the night?"" "
3,1,4,15,03010415," The woman came out, wishing to be helpful."
3,1,4,16,03010416,"     ""Nowhere,""  said the boy gruffly. ""Nowhere at all."""
3,1,4,17,03010417,    He pushed Genji through the door. Dawn was approaching. The woman caught sight of another figure in the moonlight.
3,1,4,18,03010418,"     ""And who is with you?"
3,1,4,19,03010419," Oh, Mimbu, of course. Only Mimbu reaches such splendid heights."""
3,1,4,20,03010420,"  Mimbu was a lady who was the victim of much humor because of her unusual stature. So he was out walking with Mimbu, muttered the old woman."
3,1,4,21,03010421," ""One of these days you'll be as tall as Mimbu yourself."""
3,1,4,22,03010422,"  Chattering away, she followed after them. Genji was horrified, but could not very well shove her inside. He pulled back into the darkness of a gallery."
3,1,4,23,03010423,"    Still she followed. ""You've been with our lady, have you? I've been having a bad time with my stomach these last few days and I've kept to my room. But she called me last night and said she wanted more people around. I'm still having a terrible time. Terrible,"""
3,1,4,24,03010424,"  she muttered again, getting no answer."
3,1,4,25,03010425," ""Well, goodbye, then.""<br>    She moved on, and Genji made his escape. He saw more than ever how dangerous these adventures can be."
3,1,5,1,03010501,"    The boy went with him to Nijo~. Genji recounted the happenings of the night. The boy had not done very well, he said, shrugging his shoulders in annoyance at the thought of the woman's coldness. The boy could find no answer."
3,1,5,2,03010502,"     ""I am rejected, and there is nothing to be done for me. But why could s e not have sent a pleasant answer? I'm no match for that husband of hers. That's where the trouble lies."""
3,1,5,3,03010503,"  But when he went to bed he had her cloak beneath his own. He kept the boy beside him, audience for his laments."
3,1,5,4,03010504,"     ""It's not that you aren't a nice enough boy, and it's not that I'm not fond of you. But because of your family I must have doubts about the durability of our relationship."""
3,1,5,5,03010505,    A remark which plunged the boy into the darkest melancholy.
3,1,5,6,03010506,    Genji was still unable to sleep. He said that he required an inkstone. On a fold of paper he jotted down a verse as if for practice:
3,1,5,7,03010507,"            ""Beneath a tree, a locust's empty shell.<br>            Sadly I muse upon the shell of a lady."""
3,1,5,8,03010508,"    He wondered what the other one, the stepdaughter, would be thinking of him; but though he felt rather sorry for her and though he turned the matter over in his mind, he sent no message. The lady's fragrance lingered in the robe he had taken. He kept it with him, gazing fondly at it."
3,1,5,9,03010509,"    The boy, when he went to his sister's house, was crushed by the scolding he received."
3,1,5,10,03010510," ""This is the sort of thing a person cannot be expected to put up with. I may try to explain what has happened, but can you imagine that people will not come to their own conclusions? Does it not occur to you that even your good master might wish to see an end to this childishness?"""
3,1,5,11,03010511,"    Badgered from the left and badgered from the right, the poor boy did not know where to turn. He took out Genji's letter. In spite of herself his sister opened and read it. That reference to the shell of the locust: he had taken her robe, then. How very embarrassing. A sodden rag, like the one discarded by the fisherman of Ise.*"
3,1,5,12,03010512,"    The other lady, her stepdaughter, returned in some disorder to her own west wing. She had her sad thoughts all to herself, for no one knew what had happened. She watched the boy's comings and goings, thinking that there might be some word; but in the end there was none. She did not have the imagination to guess that she had been a victim of mistaken identity. She was a lighthearted and inattentive creature, but now she was lost in sad thoughts."
3,1,5,13,03010513,"    The lady in the main hall kept herself under tight control. She could see that his feelings were not to be described as shallow, and she longed for what would not return, her maiden days. Besides his poem she jotted down a poem by Lady Ise:"
3,1,5,14,03010514,"          The dew upon the fragile locust wing<br>          Is lost among the leaves. Lost are my tears.*"
3,1,5,15,03010515,""
