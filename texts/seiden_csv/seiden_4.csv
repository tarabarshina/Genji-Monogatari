4,1,1,1,04010101," On his way from court to pay one of his calls at Rokujo~, Genji stopped to inquire after his old nurse, Koremitsu's mother, at her house in Gojo~. Gravely ill, she had become a nun."
4,1,1,2,04010102," The carriage entrance was closed. He sent for Koremitsu and while he was waiting looked up and down the dirty, cluttered street. Beside the nurse's house was a new fence of plaited cypress. The four or five narrow shutters above had been raised, and new blinds, white and clean, hung in the apertures. He caught outlines of pretty foreheads beyond."
4,1,1,3,04010103," He would have judged, as they moved about, that they belonged to rather tall women. What sort of women might they be? His carriage was simple and unadorned and he had no outrunners."
4,1,1,4,04010104," Quite certain that he would not be recognized, he leaned out for a closer look. The hanging gate, of something like trelliswork, was propped on a pole, and he could see that the house was tiny and flimsy. He felt a little sorry for the occupants of such a place--and then asked himself who in this world had more than a temporary shelter.* A hut, a jeweled pavilion, they were the same."
4,1,1,5,04010105," A pleasantly green vine was climbing a board wall. The white flowers, he thought, had a rather self-satisfied look about them."
4,1,1,6,04010106,"    ""'I needs must ask the lady far off yonder,'""+ he said, as if to himself."
4,1,1,7,04010107,"    An attendant came up, bowing deeply."
4,1,1,8,04010108," ""The white flowers far off yonder are known as 'evening faces,'""* he said."" A very human Sort of name--and what a shabby place they have picked to bloom in."""
4,1,1,9,04010109,"    It was as the man said. The neighborhood was a poor one, chiefly of small houses. Some were leaning precariously, and there were ""evening faces""  at the sagging eaves."
4,1,1,10,04010110,"     ""A hapless sort of flower. pick one off for me, would you?"""
4,1,1,11,04010111,    The man went inside the raised gate and broke off a flower.
4,1,1,12,04010112," A pretty little girl in long, unlined yellow trousers of raw silk came out through a sliding door that seemed too good for the surroundings. Beckoning to the man, she handed him a heavily scented white fan."
4,1,1,13,04010113,"     ""put it on this. It isn't much of a fan, but then it isn't much of a flower either."""
4,1,1,14,04010114,"    Koremitsu, coming out of the gate, passed it on to Genji."
4,1,1,15,04010115,"     ""They lost the key, and I have had to keep you waiting. You aren't likely to be recognized in such a neighborhood, but it's not a very nice neighborhood to keep you waiting in."""
4,1,1,16,04010116,"    Genji's carriage was pulled in and he dismounted. Besides Koremitsu, a son and a daughter, the former an eminent cleric, and the daughter's husband, the governor of Mikawa, were in attendance upon the old woman. They thanked him profusely for his visit."
4,1,1,17,04010117,    The old woman got up to receive him.
4,1,1,18,04010118," ""I did not at all mind leaving the world, except for the thought that I would no longer be able to see you as I am seeing you now. My vows seem to have given me a new lease on life, and this visit makes me certain that I shall receive the radiance of Lord Amita~bha with a serene and tranquil heart."""
4,1,1,19,04010119,  And she collapsed in tears.
4,1,1,20,04010120,"    Genji was near tears himself. ""It has worried me enormously that you should be taking so long to recover, and I was very sad to learn that you have withdrawn from the world. You must live a long life and see the career I make for myself. I am sure that if you do you will be reborn upon the highest summits of the Pure Land. I am told that it is important to rid oneself of the smallest regret for this world."""
4,1,1,21,04010121,"    Fond of the child she has reared, a nurse tends to look upon him as a paragon even if he is a half-wit. How much prouder was the old woman, who somehow gained stature, who thought of herself as eminent in her own right for having been permitted to serve him. The tears flowed on."
4,1,1,22,04010122,    Her children were ashamed for her. They exchanged glances. It would not do to have these contortions taken as signs of a lingering affection for the world.
4,1,1,23,04010123,    Genji was deeply touched.
4,1,1,24,04010124," ""The people who were fond of me left me when I was very young. Others have come along, it is true, to take care of me, but you are the only one I am really attached to. In recent years there have been restrictions upon my movements, and I have not been able to look in upon you morning and evening as I would have wished, or indeed to have a good visit with you. Yet I become very depressed when the days go by and I do not see you.'Would that there were on this earth no final partings.'""*"
4,1,1,25,04010125," He spoke with great solemnity, and the scent of his sleeve, as he brushed away a tear, quite flooded the room.<br>    Yes, thought the children, who had been silently reproaching their mother for her want of control, the fates had been kind to her. They too were now in tears."
4,1,1,26,04010126,"    Genji left orders that prayers and services be resumed. As he went out he asked for a torch, and in its light examined the fan on which the ""evening face""  had rested. It was permeated with a lady's perfume, elegant and alluring. On it was a poem in a disguised cursive hand that suggested breeding and taste. He was interested."
4,1,1,27,04010127,"          ""I think I need not ask whose face it is,<br>       So bright, this evening face, in the shining dew."""
4,1,1,28,04010128,
4,1,1,29,04010129,"     ""Who is living in the house to the west?""  he asked Koremitsu. ""Have you perhaps had occasion to inquire?"""
4,1,1,30,04010130,"    At it again, thought Koremitsu. He spoke somewhat tartly."
4,1,1,31,04010131," ""I must confess that these last few days I have been too busy with my mother to think about her neighbors."""
4,1,1,32,04010132,
4,1,1,33,04010133,"     ""You are annoyed with me. But this fan has the appearance of something it might be interesting to look into. Make inquiries, if you will, please, of someone who knows the neighborhood."""
4,1,1,34,04010134,"    Koremitsu went in to ask his mother's steward,"
4,1,1,35,04010135," and emerged with the information that the house belonged to a certain honorary vice- governor.* ""The husband is away in the country, and the wife seems to be a young woman of taste. Her sisters are out in service here and there. They often come visiting. I suspect the fellow is too poorly placed to know the details."""
4,1,1,36,04010136,"    His poetess would be one of the sisters, thought Genji. A rather practiced and forward young person, and, were he to meet her, perhaps vulgar as well--but the easy familiarity of the poem had not been at all unpleasant, not something to be pushed away in disdain. His amative propensities, it will be seen, were having their way once more.<br>    Carefully disguising his hand, he jotted down a reply on a piece of notepaper and sent it in by the attendant who had earlier been of service."
4,1,1,37,04010137,"         ""Come a bit nearer, please. Then might you know<br>       Whose was the evening face so dim in the twilight."""
4,1,1,38,04010138,
4,1,1,39,04010139,"    Thinking it a familiar profile, the lady had not lost the opportunity to surprise him with a letter, and when time passed and there was no answer she was left feeling somewhat embarrassed and disconsolate. Now came a poem by special messenger. Her women became quite giddy as they turned their minds to the problem of replying. Rather bored with it all, the messenger returned empty-handed."
4,1,1,40,04010140," Genji made a quiet departure, lighted by very few torches. The shutters next door had been lowered. There was something sad about the light, dimmer than fireflies, that came through the cracks."
4,1,1,41,04010141,"    At the Rokujo~ house, the trees and the plantings had a quiet dignity. The lady herself was strangely cold and withdrawn. Thoughts of the ""evening faces""  quite left him."
4,1,1,42,04010142," He overslept, and the sun was rising when he took his leave. He presented such a fine figure in the morning light that the women of the place understood well enough why he should be so universally admired. "
4,1,1,43,04010143,"On his way he again passed those shutters, as he had no doubt done many times before. Because of that small incident he now looked at the house carefully, wondering who might be within."
4,1,2,1,04010201,
4,1,2,2,04010202,"     ""My mother is not doing at all well, and I have been with her,"" "
4,1,2,3,04010203," said Koremitsu some days later. And, coming nearer: "
4,1,2,4,04010204,"""Because you seemed so interested, I called someone who knows about the house next door and had him questioned. His story was not completely clear. He said that in the Fifth Month or so someone came very quietly to live in the house, but that not even the domestics had been told who she might be."
4,1,2,5,04010205, I have looked through the fence from time to time myself and had glimpses through blinds of several young women. Something about their dress suggests that they are in the service of someone of higher rank.*
4,1,2,6,04010206," Yesterday, when the evening light was coming directly through, I saw the lady herself writing a letter. She is very beautiful. She seemed lost in thought, and the women around her were weeping."""
4,1,2,7,04010207,    Genji had suspected something of the sort. He must find out more.
4,1,2,8,04010208,"    Koremitsu's view was that while Genji was undeniably someone the whole world took seriously, his youth and the fact that women found him attractive meant that to refrain from these little affairs would be less than human. It was not realistic to hold that certain people were beyond temptation."
4,1,2,9,04010209,"     ""Looking for a chance to do a bit of exploring, I found a small pretext for writing to her. She answered immediately, in a good, practiced hand. Some of her women do not seem at all beneath contempt."""
4,1,2,10,04010210,
4,1,2,11,04010211,"     ""Explore very thoroughly, if you will. I will not be satisfied until you do."""
4,1,2,12,04010212,"    The house was what the guardsman would have described as the lowest of the low, but Genji was interested. What hidden charms might he not come upon!"
4,2,1,1,04020101,"    He had thought the coldness of the governor's wife, the lady of ""the locust shell,""  quite unique. Yet if she had proved amenable to his persua- sions the affair would no doubt have been dropped as a sad mistake after that one encounter. As matters were, the resentment and the distinct possibility of final defeat never left his mind. The discussion that rainy night would seem to have made him curious about the several ranks."
4,2,1,2,04020102," There had been a time when such a lady would not have been worth his notice. Yes, it had been broadening, that discussion! He had not found the willing and available one, the governor of Iyo's daughter, entirely uninteresting, but the thought that the stepmother must have been listening coolly to the interview was excruciating. He must await some sign of her real intentions.<br>    The governor of iyo returned to the city."
4,2,1,3,04020103," He came immediately to Genji's mansion. Somewhat sunburned, his travel robes rumpled from the sea voyage, he was a rather heavy and displeasing sort of person. He was of good lineage, however, and, though aging, he still had good manners."
4,2,1,4,04020104," As they spoke of his province, Genji wanted to ask the full count of those hot springs,* but he was somewhat confused to find memories chasing one another through his head."
4,2,1,5,04020105," How foolish that he should be so uncomfortable before the honest old man! He remembered the guardsman's warning that such affairs are unwise,+ and he felt sorry for the governor. Though he resented the wife's coldness, he could see that from the husband's point of view it was admirable."
4,2,1,6,04020106," He was upset to learn that the governor meant to find a suitable husband for his daughter and take his wife to the prov- inces. He consulted the lady's young brother upon the possibility of another meeting. It would have been difficult even with the lady's cooperation, however, and she was of the view that to receive a gentleman so far above her would be extremely unwise."
4,2,1,7,04020107,"    Yet she did not want him to forget her entirely. Her answers to his notes on this and that occasion were pleasant enough, and contained casual little touches that made him pause in admiration. He resented her chilliness, but she interested him."
4,2,1,8,04020108," As for the stepdaughter, he was certain that she would receive him hospitably enough however formidable a husband she might acquire. Reports upon her arrangements disturbed him not at all."
4,3,1,1,04030101,"    Autumn came. He was kept busy and unhappy by affairs of his own making, and he visited Sanjo~ infrequently. There was resentment."
4,3,1,2,04030102,"    As for the affair at Rokujo~, he had overcome the lady's resistance and had his way, and, alas, he had cooled toward her. People thought it worthy of comment that his passions should seem so much more governable than before he had made her his."
4,3,1,3,04030103," She was subject to fits of despondency, more intense on sleepless nights when she awaited him in vain. She feared that if rumors were to spread the gossips would make much of the difference in their ages."
4,3,1,4,04030104,"    On a morning of heavy mists, insistently roused by the lady, who was determined that he be on his way, Genji emerged yawning and sighing and looking very sleepy. Chu~jo~, one of her women, raised a shutter and pulled a curtain aside as if urging her lady to come forward and see him off. The lady lifted her head from her pillow."
4,3,1,5,04030105," He was an incomparably handsome figure as he paused to admire the profusion of flowers below the veranda. Chu~jo~ followed him down a gallery. In an aster robe that matched the season pleasantly and a gossamer train worn with clean elegance, she was a pretty, graceful woman."
4,3,1,6,04030106," Glancing back, he asked her to sit with him for a time at the corner railing. The ceremonious precision of the seated figure and the hair flowing over her robes were very fine."
4,3,1,7,04030107,"    He took her hand.<br>      ""Though loath to be taxed with seeking fresher blooms,<br>        I feel impelled to pluck this morning glory."
4,3,1,8,04030108,"     ""Why should it be?"""
4,3,1,9,04030109,"    She answered with practiced alacrity, making it seem that she was speaking not for herself but for her lady:"
4,3,1,10,04030110,"         'In haste to plunge into the morning mists,<br>                 to have no heart for the blossoms here."""
4,3,1,11,04030111,
4,3,1,12,04030112,"    A pretty little page boy, especially decked out for the occasion, it would seem, walked out among the flowers. His trousers wet with dew, he broke off a morning glory for Genji. He made a picture that called out to be painted."
4,3,1,13,04030113,"    Even persons to whom Genji was nothing were drawn to him. No doubt even rough mountain men wanted to pause for a time in the shade of the flowering tree,* and those who had basked even briefly in his radiance had thoughts, each in accordance with his rank, of a daughter who might be taken into his service, a not ill-formed sister who might perform some humble service for him."
4,3,1,14,04030114," One need not be surprised, then, that people with a measure of sensibility among those who had on some occasion received a little poem from him or been treated to some little kindness found him much on their minds. No doubt it distressed them not to be always with him."
4,4,1,1,04040101,    I had forgotten: Koremitsu gave a good account of the fence peeping to which he had been assigned.
4,4,1,2,04040102,"  ""I am unable to identify her. She seems determined to hide herself from the world. In their boredom her women and girls go out to the long gallery at the street, the one with the shutters, and watch for carriages. Sometimes the lady who seems to be their mistress comes quietly out to join them. I've not had a good loo  at her, but she seems very pretty indeed."
4,4,1,3,04040103," One day a carriage with outrunners went by. The little girls shouted to a person named Ukon that she must come in a hurry. The captain* was going by, they said. An older woman came out and motioned to them to be quiet. How did they know? she asked, coming out toward the gallery."
4,4,1,4,04040104," The passage from the main house is by a sort of makeshift bridge. She was hurrying and her skirt caught on something, and she stumbled and almost fell off.'The sort of thing the god of Katsuragi might do,'+ she said, and seems to have lost interest in sightseeing."
4,4,1,5,04040105," They told her that the man in the carriage was wearing casual court dress and that he had a retinue. They mentioned several names, and all of them were undeniably Lord To~ no Chu~jo~'s guards and pages."""
4,4,1,6,04040106,"     ""I wish you had made positive identification."""
4,4,1,7,04040107,  Might she be the lady of whom To~ no Chu~jo~ had spoken so regretfully that rainy night?
4,4,1,8,04040108,"    Koremitsu went on, smiling at this open curiosity. ""I have as a matter of fact made the proper overtures and learned all about the place. I come and go as if I did not know that they are not all equals. They think they are hiding the truth and try to insist that there is no one there but them- selves when one of the little girls makes a slip."""
4,4,1,9,04040109,"     ""Let me have a peep for myself when I call on your mother."""
4,4,1,10,04040110,"    Even if she was only in temporary lodgings, the woman would seem to be of the lower class for which his friend had indicated such contempt that rainy evening. Yet something might come of it all."
4,4,1,11,04040111," Determined not to go against his master's wishes in the smallest detail and himself driven by very considerable excitement, Koremitsu searched diligently for a chance to let Genji into the house. But the details are tiresome, and I shall not go into them."
4,4,1,12,04040112,"    Genji did not know who the lady was and he did not want her to know who he was. In very shabby disguise, he set out to visit her on foot. He must be taking her very seriously, thought Koremitsu, who offered his horse and himself went on foot."
4,4,1,13,04040113,"     ""Though I do not think that our gentleman will look very good with tramps for servants.""<br>    To make quite certain that the expedition remained secret, Genji took with him only the man who had been his intermediary in the matter of the ""evening faces""  and a page whom no one was likely to recognize. Lest he be found out even so, he did not stop to see his nurse."
4,4,1,14,04040114,"    The lady had his messengers followed to see how he made his way home and tried by every means to learn where he lived; but her efforts came to nothing. For all his secretiveness, Genji had grown fond of her and felt that he must go on seeing her. They were of such different ranks, he tried to tell himself, and it was altogether too frivolous. Yet his visits were frequent."
4,4,1,15,04040115," In affairs of this sort, which can muddle the senses of the most serious and honest of men, he had always kept himself under tight control and avoided any occasion for censure. Now, to a most astonishing degree, he would be asking himself as he returned in the morning from a visit how he could wait through the day for the next. And then he would rebuke himself. It was madness, it was not an affair he should let disturb him. She was of an extraordinarily gentle and quiet nature. Though there was a certain vagueness about her, and indeed an almost childlike quality, it was clear that she knew something about men. She did not appear to be of very good family. What was there about her, he asked himself over and over again, that so drew him to her?"
4,4,1,16,04040116,"    He took great pains to hide his rank and always wore travel dress, and he did not allow her to see his face. He came late at night when everyone was asleep. She was frightened, as if he were an apparition from an old story. She did not need to see his face to know that he was a fine gentleman. But who might he be? Her suspicions turned to Koremitsu. It was that young gallant, surely, who had brought the strange visitor. But Koremitsu pursued his own little affairs unremittingly, careful to feign indifference to and ignorance of this other affair. What could it all mean? The lady was lost in unfamiliar speculations."
4,4,2,1,04040201,"    Genji had his own worries. If, having lowered his guard with an appearance of complete unreserve, she were to slip away and hide, where would he seek her? This seemed to be but a temporary residence, and he could not be sure when she would choose to change it, and for what other. He hoped that he might reconcile himself to what must be and forget the affair as just another dalliance; but he was not confident."
4,4,2,2,04040202,"    On days when, to avoid attracting notice, he refrained from visiting her, his fretfulness came near anguish. Suppose he were to move her in secret to Nijo~. If troublesome rumors were to arise, well, he could say that they had been fated from the start. He wondered what bond in a former life might have produced an infatuation such as he had not known before."
4,4,2,3,04040203,"     ""Let's have a good talk,""  he said to her, ""where we can be quite at our ease."
4,4,2,4,04040204,
4,4,2,5,04040205,"     ""It's all so strange. What you say is reasonable enough, but what you do is so strange. And rather frightening."""
4,4,2,6,04040206,"    Yes, she might well be frightened. Something childlike in her fright brought a smile to his lips."
4,4,2,7,04040207," ""Which of us is the mischievous fox spirit? I wonder. Just be quiet and give yourself up to its persuasions."""
4,4,2,8,04040208,"    Won over by his gentle warmth, she was indeed inclined to let him have his way. She seemed such a pliant little creature, likely to submit absolutely to the most outrageous demands. He thought again of To~ no Chu~jo~'s ""wild carnation,""  of the equable nature his friend had described that rainy night. Fearing that it would be useless, he did not try very hard to question her."
4,4,2,9,04040209," She did not seem likely to indulge in dramatics and suddenly run off and hide herself, and so the fault must have been To~ no Chu~jo~'s. Genji himself would not be guilty of such negligence--though it did occur to him that a bit of infidelity* might make her more interesting."
4,4,2,10,04040210,"    The bright full moon of the Eighth Month came flooding in through chinks in the roof. It was not the sort of dwelling he was used to, and he was fascinated. Toward dawn he was awakened by plebeian voices in the shabby houses down the street."
4,4,2,11,04040211,"     ""Freezing, that's what it is, freezing. There's not much business this year, and when you can't get out into the country you feel like giving up. Do you hear me, neighbor?"""
4,4,2,12,04040212,
4,4,2,13,04040213,    He could make out every word.
4,4,2,14,04040214," It embarrassed the woman that, so near at hand, there should be this clamor of preparation as people set forth on their sad little enterprises."
4,4,2,15,04040215," Had she been one of the stylish ladies of the world, she would have wanted to shrivel up and disappear. She was a placid sort, however, and she seemed to take nothing, painful or embar- rassing or unpleasant, too seriously. Her manner elegant and yet girlish, she did not seem to know what the rather awful clamor up and down the street might mean. He much preferred this easygoing bewilderment to a show of consternation, a face scarlet with embarrassment."
4,4,2,16,04040216," As if at his very pillow, there came the booming of a foot pestle,+ more fearsome than the stamping of the thunder god, genuinely earsplitting. He did not know what device the sound came from, but he did know that it was enough to awaken the dead."
4,4,2,17,04040217," From this direction and that there came the faint thump of fulling hammers against coarse cloth; and mingled with it--these were sounds to call forth the deepest emotions--were the calls of geese flying overhead. He slid a door open and they looked out. They had been lying near the veranda. There were tasteful clumps of black bamboo just outside and the dew shone as in more familiar places. Autumn insects sang busily, as if only inches from an ear used to wall crickets at considerable distances. It was all very clamorous, and also rather wonderful."
4,4,2,18,04040218," Countless details could be overlooked in the singleness of his affection for the girl. She was pretty and fragile in a soft, modest cloak of lavender and a lined white robe. She had no single feature that struck him as especially beautiful, and yet, slender and fragile, she seemed so delicately beautiful that he was almost afraid to hear her voice. He might have wished her to be a little more assertive, but he wanted only to be near her, and yet nearer."
4,4,2,19,04040219,"     ""Let's go off somewhere and enjoy the rest of the night. This is too much."""
4,4,2,20,04040220,"     ""But how is that possible?""  She spoke very quietly. ""You keep taking me by surprise."""
4,4,2,21,04040221,"    There was a newly confiding response to his offer of his services as guardian in this world and the next. She was a strange little thing. He found it hard to believe that she had had much experience of men. He no longer cared what people might think. He asked Ukon to summon his man, who got the carriage ready. The women of the house, though uneasy, sensed the depth of his feelings and were inclined to put their trust in him."
4,4,2,22,04040222,"    Dawn approached. No cocks were crowing. There was only the voice of an old man making deep obeisance to a Buddha, in preparation, it would seem, for a pilgrimage to Mitake.* He seemed to be prostrating himself repeatedly and with much difficulty. All very sad. In a life itself like the morning dew, what could he desire so earnestly?<br>     ""Praise to the Messiah to come,""  intoned the voice."
4,4,2,23,04040223,"     ""Listen,""  said Genji. ""He is thinking of another world."
4,4,2,24,04040224,"         ""This pious one shall lead us on our way<br>       As we plight our troth for all the lives to come."""
4,4,2,25,04040225,"    The vow exchanged by the Chinese emperor and Yang Kuei-fei seemed to bode ill, and so he preferred to invoke Lord Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future; but such promises are rash."
4,4,2,26,04040226,"        ""So heavy the burden I bring with me from the past,<br>     I doubt that I should make these vows for the future."""
4,4,2,27,04040227,"    It was a reply that suggested doubts about his ""lives to come."""
4,4,3,1,04040301,"    The moon was low over the western hills. She was reluctant to go with him. As he sought to persuade her, the moon suddenly disappeared behind clouds in a lovely dawn sky. Always in a hurry to be off before daylight exposed him, he lifted her easily into his carriage and took her to a nearby villa. Ukon was with them."
4,4,3,2,04040302," Waiting for the caretaker to be summoned, Genji looked up at the rotting gate and the ferns that trailed thickly down over it. The groves beyond were still dark, and the mist and the dews were heavy. Genji's sleeve was soaking, for he had raised the blinds of the carriage."
4,4,3,3,04040303,"     ""This is a novel adventure, and I must say that it seems like a lot of trouble."
4,4,3,4,04040304,"      ""And did it confuse them too, the men of old,<br>      This road through the dawn, for me so new and strange?"
4,4,3,5,04040305,"    ""How does it seem to you?"""
4,4,3,6,04040306,    She turned shyly away.
4,4,3,7,04040307,"       ""And is the moon, unsure of the hills it approaches,<br>          Foredoomed to lose its way in the empty skies?"
4,4,3,8,04040308,"    ""I am afraid."""
4,4,3,9,04040309,"    She did seem frightened, and bewildered. She was so used to all those swarms of people, he thought with a smile."
4,4,3,10,04040310,"    The carriage was brought in and its traces propped against the veranda while a room was made ready in the west wing. Much excited, Ukon was thinking about earlier adventures. The furious energy with which the caretaker saw to preparations made her suspect who Genji was."
4,4,3,11,04040311," It was almost daylight when they alighted from the carriage. The room was clean and pleasant, for all the haste with which it had been readied."
4,4,3,12,04040312,"    ""There are unfortunately no women here to wait upon His Lordship.""  The man, who addressed him through Ukon, was a lesser steward who had served in the Sanjo~ mansion of Genji's father-in-law. ""Shall I send for someone?"""
4,4,3,13,04040313,"    ""The last thing I want. I came here because I wanted to be in complete solitude, away from all possible visitors. You are not to tell a soul."""
4,4,3,14,04040314,"    The man put together a hurried breakfast, but he was, as he had said, without serving women to help him.<br>    Genji told the girl that he meant to show her a love as dependable as ""the patient river of the loons."" * He could do little else in these strange lodgings."
4,4,3,15,04040315,"    The sun was high when he arose. He opened the shutters. All through the badly neglected grounds not a person was to be seen. The groves were rank and overgrown. The flowers and grasses in the foreground were a drab monotone, an autumn moor. The pond was choked with weeds, and all in all it was a forbidding place. An outbuilding seemed to be fitted with rooms for the caretaker, but it was some distance away."
4,4,3,16,04040316,"    ""It is a forbidding place,"" + said Genji. ""But I am sure that whatever devils emerge will pass me by."""
4,4,3,17,04040317,"    He was still in disguise. She thought it unkind of him to be so secre- tive, and he had to agree that their relationship had gone beyond such furtiveness."
4,4,3,18,04040318,"           ""Because of one chance meeting by the wayside<br>          The flower now opens in the evening dew."
4,4,3,19,04040319,"    ""And how does it look to you?"""
4,4,3,20,04040320,
4,4,3,21,04040321,"    ""The face seemed quite to shine in the evening dew,<br>        But I was dazzled by the evening light."""
4,4,3,22,04040322,"    Her eyes turned away. She spoke in a whisper.<br>    To him it may have seemed an interesting poem.<br>    As a matter of fact, she found him handsomer than her poem sug- gested, indeed frighteningly handsome, given the setting."
4,4,3,23,04040323,"    ""I hid my name from you because I thought it altogether too unkind of you to be keeping your name from me. Do please tell me now. This silence makes me feel that something awful might be coming."""
4,4,3,24,04040324,"    ""Call me the fisherman's daughter."" * Still hiding her name, she was like a little child."
4,4,3,25,04040325,"    ""I see. I brought it all on myself? A case of warekara?"" +<br>    And so, sometimes affectionately, sometimes reproachfully, they talked the hours away."
4,4,3,26,04040326,"    Koremitsu had found them out and brought provisions. Feeling a little guilty about the way he had treated Ukon, he did not come near. He thought it amusing that Genji should thus be wandering the streets, and concluded that the girl must provide sufficient cause. And he could have had her himself, had he not been so generous."
4,4,3,27,04040327,"    Genji and the girl looked out at an evening sky of the utmost calm. Because she found the darkness in the recesses of the house frightening, he raised the blinds at the veranda and they lay side by side. As they gazed at each other in the gathering dusk, it all seemed very strange to her, unbelievably strange. Memories of past wrongs quite left her. She was more at ease with him now, and he thought her charming. Beside him all through the day, starting up in fright at each little noise, she seemed delightfully childlike. He lowered the shutters earl y and had lights brought.<br>    ""You seem comfortable enough with me, and yet you raise difficulties."""
4,4,3,28,04040328,"    At court everyone would be frantic. Where would the search be di- rected? He thought what a strange love it was, and he thought of the turmoil the Rokujo~ lady was certain to be in.# She had every right to be resentful, and yet her jealous ways were not pleasant. It was that sad lady to whom his thoughts first turned. Here was the girl beside him, so simple and undemanding; and the other was so impossibly forceful in her demands. How he wished he might in some measure have his freedom."
4,4,4,1,04040401,    It was past midnight. He had been asleep for a time when an exceed- ingly beautiful woman appeared by his pillow.
4,4,4,2,04040402,"    ""You do not even think of visiting me, when you are so much on my mind. Instead you go running off with someone who has nothing to recom- mend her, and raise a great stir over her. It is cruel, intolerable."""
4,4,4,3,04040403,  She seemed about to shake the girl from her sleep.
4,4,4,4,04040404," He awoke, feeling as if he were in the power of some malign being. The light had gone out. In great alarm, he pulled his sword to his pillow and awakened Ukon. She too seemed frightened."
4,4,4,5,04040405,"    ""Go out to the gallery and wake the guard. Have him bring a light."""
4,4,4,6,04040406,"    ""It's much too dark."""
4,4,4,7,04040407,"    He forced a smile. ""You're behaving like a child.""<br>    He clapped his hands and a hollow echo answered. No one seemed to hear. The girl was trembling violently. She was bathed in sweat and as if in a trance, quite bereft of her senses."
4,4,4,8,04040408,"    ""She is such a timid little thing,""  said Ukon, ""frightened when there is nothing at all to be frightened of. This must be dreadful for her.""<br>    Yes, poor thing, thought Genji. She did seem so fragile, and she had spent the whole day gazing up at the sky."
4,4,4,9,04040409,"    ""I'll go get someone. What a frightful echo. You stay here with her."""
4,4,4,10,04040410,"  He pulled Ukon to the girl's side.<br>    The lights in the west gallery had gone out."
4,4,4,11,04040411," There was a gentle wind. He had few people with him, and they were asleep. They were three in number: a young man who was one of his intimates and who was the son of the steward here, a court page, and the man who had been his intermedi- ary in the matter of the ""evening faces.""  He called out. Someone answered and came up to him."
4,4,4,12,04040412,"    ""Bring a light. Wake the other, and shout and twang your bowstrings. What do you mean, going to sleep in a deserted house? I believe Lord Koremitsu was here."""
4,4,4,13,04040413,"    ""He was. But he said he had no orders and would come again at dawn.""<br>    An elite guardsman, the man was very adept at bow twanging. He went off with a shouting as of a fire watch. At court, thought Genji, the courtiers on night duty would have announced themselves, and the guard would be changing. It was not so very late."
4,4,4,14,04040414,"    He felt his way back inside. The girl was as before, and Ukon lay face down at her side."
4,4,4,15,04040415,"    ""What is this? You're a fool to let yourself be so frightened. Are you worried about the fox spirits that come out and play tricks in deserted houses? But you needn't worry. They won't come near me.""  He pulled her to her knees."
4,4,4,16,04040416,"    ""I'm not feeling at all well. That's why I was lying down. My poor lady must be terrified."""
4,4,4,17,04040417,"    ""She is indeed. And I can't think why.""<br>    He reached for the girl. She was not breathing. He lifted her and she was limp in his arms. There was no sign of life. She had seemed as defense- less as a child, and no doubt some evil power had taken possession of her. He could think of nothing to do."
4,4,4,18,04040418," A man came with a torch. Ukon was not prepared to move, and Genji himself pulled up curtain frames to hide the girl."
4,4,4,19,04040419,"    ""Bring the light closer."""
4,4,4,20,04040420,"    It was most a unusual order. Not ordinarily permitted at Genji's side, the man hesitated to cross the threshold."
4,4,4,21,04040421,"    ""Come, come, bring it here! There is a time and place for ceremony."""
4,4,4,22,04040422,    In the torchlight he had a fleeting glimpse of a figure by the girl's pillow.
4,4,4,23,04040423," It was the woman in his dream. It faded away like an apparition in an old romance. In all the fright and honor, his confused thoughts centered upon the girl. There was no room for thoughts of himself.<br>    He knelt over her and called out to her, but she was cold and had stopped breathing. It was too horrible. He had no confidant to whom he could turn for advice. It was the clergy one thought of first on such occasions. He had been so brave and confident, but he was young, and this was too much for him. He clung to the lifeless body."
4,4,4,24,04040424,"    ""Come back, my dear, my dear. Don't do this awful thing to me."" "
4,4,4,25,04040425, But she was cold and no longer seemed human.
4,4,4,26,04040426,    The first paralyzing terror had left Ukon. Now she was writhing and wailing.
4,4,4,27,04040427, Genji remembered a devil a certain minister had encountered in the Grand Hall.*
4,4,4,28,04040428,"    ""She can't possibly be dead.""  He found the strength to speak sharply. ""All this noise in the middle of the night--you must try to be a little quieter."" "
4,4,4,29,04040429, But it had been too sudden.
4,4,4,30,04040430,    He turned again to the torchbearer.
4,4,4,31,04040431," ""There is someone here who seems to have had a very strange seizure. Tell your friend to find out where Lord Koremitsu is spending the night and have him come immediately. If the holy man is still at his mother's house, give him word, very quietly, that he is to come too. His mother and the people with her are not to hear. She does not approve of this sort of adventure."""
4,4,4,32,04040432,"    He spoke calmly enough, but his mind was in a turmoil. Added to grief at the loss of the girl was horror, quite beyond describing, at this desolate place."
4,4,4,33,04040433," It would be past midnight. The wind was higher and whis- tled more dolefully in the pines. There came a strange, hollow call of a bird. Might it be an owl? All was silence, terrifying solitude. He should not have chosen such a place--but it was too late now."
4,4,4,34,04040434," Trembling violently, Ukon clung to him. He held her in his arms, wondering if she might be about to follow her lady. He was the only rational one present, and he could think of nothing to do."
4,4,4,35,04040435," The flickering light wandered here and there. The upper parts of the screens behind them were in darkness, the lower parts fitfully in the light. There was a persistent creaking, as of someone coming up behind them. If only Koremitsu would come. But Koremitsu was a nocturnal wanderer without a fixed abode, and the man had to search for him in numerous places. The wait for dawn was like the passage of a thousand nights."
4,4,4,36,04040436," Finally he heard a distant crowing. What legacy from a former life could have brought him to this mortal peril? He was being punished for a guilty love, his fault and no one else's, and his story would be remembered in infamy through all the ages to come. There were no secrets, strive though one might to have them. Soon everyone would know, from his royal father down, and the lowest court pages would be talking; and he would gain immortality as the model of the complete fool."
4,4,5,1,04040501,"    Finally Lord Koremitsu came. He was the perfect servant who did not go against his master's wishes in anything at any time; and Genji was angry that on this night of all nights he should have been away, and slow in answering the summons. Calling him inside even so, he could not immedi- ately find the strength to say what must be said. Ukon burst into tears, the full honor of it all coming back to her at the sight of Koremitsu. Genji too lost control of himself. The only sane and rational one present, he had held Ukon in his arms, but now he gave himself up to his grief."
4,4,5,2,04040502,"    ""Something very strange has happened,""  he said after a time. ""Strange --'unbelievable' would not be too strong a word. I wanted a priest--one does when these things happen--and asked your reverend brother to come."""
4,4,5,3,04040503,"    ""He went back up the mountain yesterday. Yes, it is very strange indeed. Had there been anything wrong with her?"""
4,4,5,4,04040504,"    ""Nothing."""
4,4,5,5,04040505,"    He was so handsome in his grief that Koremitsu wanted to weep. An older man who has had everything happen to him and knows what to expect can be depended upon in a crisis; but they were both young, and neither had anything to suggest."
4,4,5,6,04040506,"    Koremitsu finally spoke. ""We must not let the caretaker know. He may be dependable enough himself, but he is sure to have relatives who will talk. We must get away from this place."""
4,4,5,7,04040507,"    ""You aren't suggesting that we could find a place where we would be less likely to be seen?"""
4,4,5,8,04040508,"    ""No, I suppose not. And the women at her house will scream and wail when they hear about it, and they live in a crowded neighborhood, and all the mob around will hear, and that will be that. But mountain temples are used to this sort of thing. There would not be much danger of attracting attention.""  He reflected on the problem for a time."
4,4,5,9,04040509," ""There is a woman I used to know. She has gone into a nunnery up in the eastern hills. She is very old, my father's nurse, as a matter of fact. The district seems to be rather heavily populated, but the nunnery is off by itself."""
4,4,5,10,04040510,    It was not yet full daylight. Koremitsu had the carriage brought up.
4,4,5,11,04040511," Since Genji seemed incapable of the task, he wrapped the body in a covering and lifted it into the carriage. It was very tiny and very pretty, and not at all repellent. The wrapping was loose and the hair streamed forth, as if to darken the world before Genji's eyes.<br>    He wanted to see the last rites through to the end, but Koremitsu would not hear of it."
4,4,5,12,04040512," ""Take my horse and go back to Nijo~, now while the streets are still quiet."""
4,4,5,13,04040513,"    He helped Ukon into the carriage and himself proceeded on foot, the skirts of his robe hitched up. It was a strange, bedraggled sort of funeral procession, he thought, but in the face of such anguish he was prepared to risk his life. Barely conscious, Genji made his way back to Nijo-."
4,4,5,14,04040514,"    ""Where have you been?""  asked the women. ""You are not looking at all well.""<br>    He did not answer. Alone in his room, he pressed a hand to his heart. Why had he not gone with the others? What would she think if she were to come back to life? She would think that he had abandoned her. Self- reproach filled his heart to breaking. He had a headache and feared he had a fever. Might he too be dying?"
4,4,5,15,04040515," The sun was high and still he did not emerge. Thinking it all very strange, the women pressed breakfast upon him. He could not eat. A messenger reported that the emperor had been troubled by his failure to appear the day before.<br>    His brothers-in-law came calling.<br>    ""Come in, please, just for a moment.""  He received only To~ no Chu~jo~ and kept a blind between them."
4,4,5,16,04040516," ""My old nurse fell seriously ill and took her vows in the Fifth Month or so. perhaps because of them, she seemed to recover. But recently she had a relapse. Someone came to ask if I would not call on her at least once more. I thought I really must go and see an old and dear servant who was on her deathbed, and so I went."
4,4,5,17,04040517," One of her servants was ailing, and quite suddenly, before he had time to leave, he died. Out of deference to me they waited until night to take the body away. All this I learned later. It would be very improper of me to go to court with all these festivities coming up,* I thought, and so I stayed away. I have had a headache since early this morning--perhaps I have caught cold. I must apologize."""
4,4,5,18,04040518,
4,4,5,19,04040519,"    ""I see. I shall so inform your father. He sent out a search party during the concert last night, and really seemed very upset.""  To~ no Chu~jo~ turned to go, and abruptly turned back. ""Come now. What sort of brush did you really have? I don't believe a word of it."""
4,4,5,20,04040520,"    Genji was startled, but managed a show of nonchalance."
4,4,5,21,04040521," ""You needn't go into the details. Just say that I suffered an unexpected defilement. Very unexpected, really."""
4,4,5,22,04040522,"    Despite his cool manner, he was not up to facing people. He asked a younger brother-in-law to explain in detail his reasons for not going to court. He got off a note to Sanjo~ with a similar explanation."
4,4,6,1,04040601,"    Koremitsu came in the evening. Having announced that he had suf- fered a defilement, Genji had callers remain outside, and there were few people in the house. He received Koremitsu immediately."
4,4,6,2,04040602,"    ""Are you sure she is dead?""  He pressed a sleeve to his eyes."
4,4,6,3,04040603,    Koremitsu too was in tears. 
4,4,6,4,04040604,"""Yes, I fear she is most certainly dead. I could not stay shut up in a temple indefinitely, and so I have made arrange- ments with a venerable priest whom I happen to know rather well. Tomor- row is a good day for funerals."""
4,4,6,5,04040605,"    ""And the other woman?"""
4,4,6,6,04040606,"    ""She has seemed on the point of death herself. She does not want to be left behind by her lady. I was afraid this morning that she might throw herself over a cliff. She wanted to tell the people at Gojo~, but I persuaded her to let us have a little more time."""
4,4,6,7,04040607,
4,4,6,8,04040608,"    ""I am feeling rather awful myself and almost fear the worst."""
4,4,6,9,04040609,"    ""Come, now. There is nothing to be done and no point in torturing yourself. You must tell yourself that what must be must be. I shall let absolutely no one know, and I am personally taking care of everything."""
4,4,6,10,04040610,"    ""Yes, to be sure. Everything is fated. So I tell myself. But it is terrible to think that I have sent a lady to her death. You are not to tell your sister, and you must be very sure that your mother does not hear. I would not survive the scolding I would get from her."""
4,4,6,11,04040611,"    ""And the priests too: I have told them a plausible story.""  Koremitsu exuded confidence."
4,4,6,12,04040612,
4,4,6,13,04040613,"    The women had caught a hint of what was going on and were more puzzled than ever. He had said that he had suffered a defilement, and he was staying away from court; but why these muffled lamentations?"
4,4,6,14,04040614,"    Genji gave instructions for the funeral. ""You must make sure that nothing goes wrong."""
4,4,6,15,04040615,"    ""Of course. No great ceremony seems called for."""
4,4,6,16,04040616,    Koremitsu turned to leave.
4,4,6,17,04040617,"    ""I know you won't approve,""  said Genji, a fresh wave of grief sweep- ing over him, ""but I will regret it forever if I don't see her again. I'll go on horseback."""
4,4,6,18,04040618,"    ""Very well, if you must.""  In fact Koremitsu thought the proposal very ill advised."
4,4,6,19,04040619," ""Go immediately and be back while it is still early."""
4,4,6,20,04040620,    Genji set out in the travel robes he had kept ready for his recent amorous excursions.
4,4,6,21,04040621," He was in the bleakest despair. He was on a strange mission and the terrors of the night before made him consider turning back. Grief urged him on. If he did not see her once more, when, in another world, might he hope to see her as she had been? He had with him only Koremitsu and the attendant of that first encounter."
4,4,6,22,04040622," The road seemed a long one.<br>    The moon came out, two nights past full. They reached the river. In the dim torchlight, the darkness off towards Mount Toribe was ominous and forbidding; but Genji was too dazed with grief to be frightened. And so they reached the temple."
4,4,6,23,04040623,"    It was a harsh, unfriendly region at best. The board hut and chapel where the nun pursued her austerities were lonely beyond description. The light at the altar came dimly through cracks. Inside the hut a woman was weeping. In the outer chamber two or three priests were conversing and invoking the holy name in low voices. Vespers seemed to have ended in several temples nearby. Everything was quiet. There were lights and there seemed to be clusters of people in the direction of Kiyomizu. The grand tones in which the worthy monk, the son of the nun, was reading a sutra brought on what Genji thought must be the full flood tide of his tears."
4,4,6,24,04040624,"    He went inside. The light was turned away from the corpse. Ukon lay behind a screen. It must be very terrible for her, thought Genji. The girl's face was unchanged and very pretty."
4,4,6,25,04040625,"     ""Won't you let me hear your voice again?""  He took her hand. ""What was it that made me give you all my love, for so short a time, and then made you leave me to this misery?"""
4,4,6,26,04040626,  He was weeping uncontrollably.
4,4,6,27,04040627,"    The priests did not know who he was. They sensed something re- markable, however, and felt their eyes mist over."
4,4,6,28,04040628,"     ""Come with me to Nijo~,""  he said to Ukon."
4,4,6,29,04040629,"     ""We have been together since I was very young. I never left her side, not for a single moment. Where am I to go now? I will have to tell the others what has happened. As if this weren't enough, I will have to put up with their accusations.""  She was sobbing. ""I want to go with her."""
4,4,6,30,04040630,"     ""That is only natural. But it is the way of the world. Parting is always sad. Our lives must end, early or late. Try to put your trust in me.""  He comforted her with the usual homilies, but presently his real feelings came out. ""put your trust in me--when I fear I have not long to live myself."""
4,4,6,31,04040631,  He did not after all seem likely to be much help.
4,4,6,32,04040632,"     ""It will soon be light,""  said Koremitsu. ""We must be on our way."""
4,4,6,33,04040633,"    Looking back and looking back again, his heart near breaking, Genji went out."
4,4,6,34,04040634, The way was heavy with dew and the morning mists were thick. He scarcely knew where he was. The girl was exactly as she had been that night. They had exchanged robes and she had on a red singlet of his. What might it have been in other lives that had brought them together? He managed only with great difficulty to stay in his saddle. Koremitsu was at the reins. As they came to the river Genji fell from his horse and was unable to remount.
4,4,6,35,04040635,"     ""So I am to die by the wayside? I doubt that I can go on."""
4,4,6,36,04040636,"    Koremitsu was in a panic. He should not have permitted this expedi- tion, however strong Genji's wishes. Dipping his hands in the river, he turned and made supplication to Kiyomizu."
4,4,6,37,04040637," Genji somehow pulled himself together. Silently invoking the holy name, he was seen back to Nijo~."
4,4,6,38,04040638,"    The women were much upset by these untimely wanderings. ""Very bad, very bad. He has been so restless lately. And why should he have gone out again when he was not feeling well?"""
4,4,6,39,04040639,"    Now genuinely ill, he took to his bed. Two or three days passed and he was visibly thinner. The emperor heard of the illness and was much alarmed. Continuous prayers were ordered in this shrine and that temple. The varied rites, Shinto and Confucian and Buddhist, were beyond count- ing. Genji's good looks had been such as to arouse forebodings. All through the court it was feared that he would not live much longer."
4,4,6,40,04040640," Despite his illness, he summoned Ukon to Nijo~ and assigned her rooms near his own. Koremitsu composed himself sufficiently to be of service to her, for he could see that she had no one else to turn to."
4,4,6,41,04040641," Choosing times when he was feeling better, Genji would summon her for a talk, and she soon was accustomed to life at Nijo~. Dressed in deep mourning, she was a somewhat stern and forbidding young woman, but not without her good points."
4,4,6,42,04040642,"    ""It lasted such a very little while. I fear that I will be taken too. It must be dreadful for you, losing your only support. I had thought that as long as I lived I would see to all your needs, and it seems sad and ironical that I should be on the point of following her."""
4,4,6,43,04040643,"  He spoke softly and there were tears in his eyes. For Ukon the old grief had been hard enough to bear, and now she feared that a new grief might be added to it."
4,4,6,44,04040644,"    All through the Nijo~ mansion there was a sense of helplessness. Emissaries from court were thicker than raindrops. Not wanting to worry his father, Genji fought to control himself. His father-in-law was extremely solicitous and came to Nijo~ every day. perhaps because of all the prayers and rites the crisis passed--it had lasted some twenty days--and left no ill effects."
4,4,6,45,04040645," Genji's full recovery coincided with the final cleansing of the defilement. With the unhappiness he had caused his father much on his mind, he set off for his apartments at court. For a time he felt out of things, as if he had come back to a strange new world."
4,4,7,1,04040701,"    By the end of the Ninth Month he was his old self once more. He had lost weight, but emaciation only made him handsomer. He spent a great deal of time gazing into space, and sometimes he would weep aloud. He must be in the clutches of some malign spirit, thought the women. It was all most peculiar."
4,4,7,2,04040702,    He would summon Ukon on quiet evenings.
4,4,7,3,04040703," ""I don't understand it at all. Why did she so insist on keeping her name from me? Even if she was a fisherman's daughter it was cruel of her to be so uncommunicative. It was as if she did not know how much I loved her."""
4,4,7,4,04040704,"    ""There was no reason for keeping it secret. But why should she tell you about her insignificant self? Your attitude seemed so strange from the beginning. She used to say that she hardly knew whether she was waking or dreaming. Your refusal to identify yourself, you know, helped her guess who you were. It hurt her that you should belittle her by keeping your name from her."""
4,4,7,5,04040705,"    ""An unfortunate contest of wills. I did not want anything to stand between us; but I must always be worrying about what people will say. I must refrain from things my father and all the rest of them might take me to task for. I am not permitted the smallest indiscretion. Everything is exaggerated so. The little incident of the 'evening faces' affected me strangely and I went to very great trouble to see her. There must have been a bond between us."
4,4,7,6,04040706," A love doomed from the start to be fleeting--why should it have taken such complete possession of me and made me find her so precious? You must tell me everything. What point is there in keeping secrets now? I mean to make offerings every week, and I want to know in whose name I am making them."""
4,4,7,7,04040707,"    ""Yes, of course--why have secrets now? It is only that I do not want to slight what she made so much of."
4,4,7,8,04040708," Her parents are dead. Her father was a guards captain. She was his special pet, but his career did not go well and his life came to an early and disappointing end. She somehow got to know Lord To~ no Chu~jo~--it was when he was still a lieutenant. He was very attentive for three years or so,"
4,4,7,9,04040709," and then about last autumn there was a rather awful threat from his father-in-law's house. She was ridiculously timid and it frightened her beyond all reason. She ran off and hid herself at her nurse's in the western part of the city. It was a wretched little hovel of a place. She wanted to go off into the hills, but the direction she had in mind has been taboo since New Year's. So she moved to the odd place where she was so upset to have you find her."
4,4,7,10,04040710," She was more reserved and withdrawn than most people, and I fear that her unwillingness to show her emotions may have seemed cold."""
4,4,7,11,04040711,    So it was true. Affection and pity welled up yet more strongly.
4,4,7,12,04040712,"    ""He once told me of a lost child. Was there such a one?"""
4,4,7,13,04040713,"    ""Yes, a very pretty little girl, born two years ago last spring."""
4,4,7,14,04040714,"    ""Where is she? Bring her to me without letting anyone know. It would be such a comfort. I should tell my friend To~ no Chu~jo~, I suppose, but why invite criticism? I doubt that anyone could reprove me for taking in the child. You must think up a way to get around the nurse."""
4,4,7,15,04040715,"    ""It would make me very happy if you were to take the child. I would hate to have her left where she is. She is there because we had no compe- tent nurses in the house where you found us."""
4,4,7,16,04040716,"    The evening sky was serenely beautiful. The flowers below the veranda were withered, the songs of the insects were dying too, and autumn tints were coming over the maples. Looking out upon the scene, which might have been a painting, Ukon thought what a lovely asylum she had found herself. She wanted to avert her eyes at the thought of the house of the ""evening faces.""  A pigeon called, somewhat discordantly, from a bamboo thicket. Remembering how the same call had frightened the girl in that deserted villa, Genji could see the little figure as if an apparition were there before him."
4,4,7,17,04040717,"    ""How old was she? She seemed so delicate, because she was not long for this world, I suppose."""
4,4,7,18,04040718,"    ""Nineteen, perhaps? My mother, who was her nurse, died and left me behind. Her father took a fancy to me, and so we grew up together, and I never once left her side. I wonder how I can go on without her."
4,4,7,19,04040719," I am almost sorry that we were so close.* She seemed so weak, but I can see now that she was a source of strength."""
4,4,7,20,04040720,"    ""The weak ones do have a power over us. The clear, forceful ones I can do without. I am weak and indecisive by nature myself, and a woman who is quiet and withdrawn and follows the wishes of a man even to the point of letting herself be used has much the greater appeal. A man can shape and mold her as he wishes, and becomes fonder of her all the while."""
4,4,7,21,04040721,"    ""She was exactly what you would have wished, sir.""  Ukon was in tears. ""That thought makes the loss seem greater."""
4,4,7,22,04040722,"    The sky had clouded over and a chilly wind had come up. Gazing off into the distance, Genji said softly:"
4,4,7,23,04040723,"      ""One sees the clouds as smoke that rose from the pyre,<br>        And suddenly the evening sky seems nearer."""
4,4,7,24,04040724,"    Ukon was unable to answer. If only her lady were here! For Genji even the memory of those fulling blocks was sweet.<br>    ""In the Eighth Month, the Ninth Month, the nights are long,"" * he whispered, and lay down."
4,5,1,1,04050101,"    The young page, brother of the lady of the locust shell, came to Nijo~ from time to time, but Genji no longer sent messages for his sister. She was sorry that he seemed angry with her and sorry to hear of his illness. The prospect of accompanying her husband to his distant province was a dreary one. She sent off a note to see whether Genji had forgotten her."
4,5,1,2,04050102,"    ""They tell me you have not been well."
4,5,1,3,04050103,"           ""Time goes by, you ask not why I ask not.<br>           Think if you will how lonely a life is mine."
4,5,1,4,04050104,"    ""I might make reference to Masuda Pond."" +"
4,5,1,5,04050105,    This was a surprise; and indeed he had not forgotten her. The uncertain hand in which he set down his reply had its own beauty.
4,5,1,6,04050106,"    ""Who, I wonder, lives the more aimless life."
4,5,1,7,04050107,"            ""Hollow though it was, the shell of the locust<br>           Gave me strength to face a gloomy world."
4,5,1,8,04050108,"    ""But only precariously."""
4,5,1,9,04050109,"    So he still remembered ""the shell of the locust.""  She was sad and at the same time amused."
4,5,1,10,04050110," It was good that they could correspond without rancor. She wished no further intimacy, and she did not want him to despise her."
4,5,1,11,04050111,"    As for the other, her stepdaughter, Genji heard that she had married a guards lieutenant. He thought it a strange marriage and he felt a certain pity for the lieutenant. Curious to know something of her feelings, he sent a note by his young messenger."
4,5,1,12,04050112,"    ""Did you know that thoughts of you had brought me to the point of expiring?<br>       ""I bound them loosely, the reeds beneath the eaves,#<br>         And reprove them now for having come undone."""
4,5,1,13,04050113,"    He attached it to a long reed.<br>    The boy was to deliver it in secret, he said. But he thought that the lieutenant would be forgiving if he were to see it, for he would guess who the sender was. One may detect here a note of self-satisfaction."
4,5,1,14,04050114,"    Her husband was away. She was confused, but delighted that he should have remembered her. She sent off in reply a poem the only excuse for which was the alacrity with which it was composed:"
4,5,1,15,04050115,"        ""The wind brings words, all softly, to the reed,<br>      And the under leaves are nipped again by the frost."""
4,5,1,16,04050116,"    It might have been cleverer and in better taste not to have disguised the clumsy handwriting. He thought of the face he had seen by lamplight. He could forget neither of them, the governor's wife, seated so primly before him, or the younger woman, chattering on so contentedly, without the smallest suggestion of reserve. The stirrings of a susceptible heart suggested that he still had important lessons to learn."
4,6,1,1,04060101,"    Quietly, forty-ninth-day services were held for the dead lady in the Lotus Hall on Mount Hiei. There was careful attention to all the details, the priestly robes and the scrolls and the altar decorations. Koremitsu's older brother was a priest of considerable renown, and his conduct of the services was beyond reproach."
4,6,1,2,04060102," Genji summoned a doctor of letters with whom he was friendly and who was his tutor in Chinese poetry and asked him to prepare a final version of the memorial petition. Genji had prepared a draft. In moving language he committed the one he had loved and lost, though he did not mention her name, to the mercy of Amita~bha."
4,6,1,3,04060103,"    ""It is perfect, just as it is. Not a word needs to be changed."""
4,6,1,4,04060104,"  Noting the tears that refused to be held back,"
4,6,1,5,04060105," the doctor wondered who might be the subject of these prayers. That Genji should not reveal the name, and that he should be in such open grief--someone, no doubt, who had brought a very large bounty of grace from earlier lives."
4,6,1,6,04060106,    Genji attached a poem to a pair of lady's trousers which were among his secret offerings:
4,6,1,7,04060107,"            ""I weep and weep as today I tie this cord.<br>           It will be untied in an unknown world to come."""
4,6,1,8,04060108,"    He invoked the holy name with great feeling. Her spirit had wandered uncertainly these last weeks. Today it would set off down one of the ways of the future.<br>    His heart raced each time he saw To~ no Chu~jo~. He longed to tell his friend that ""the wild carnation""  was alive and well; but there was no point in calling forth reproaches."
4,6,1,9,04060109,"    In the house of the ""evening faces,""  the women were at a loss to know what had happened to their lady. They had no way of inquiring. And Ukon too had disappeared. They whispered among themselves that they had been right about that gentleman, and they hinted at their suspicions to Koremitsu. He feigned complete ignorance, however, and continued to pursue his little affairs. For the poor women it was all like a nightmare. perhaps the wanton son of some governor, fearing To~ no Chu~jo~, had spirited her off to the country?"
4,6,1,10,04060110," The owner of the house was her nurse's daughter. She was one of three children and related to Ukon. She could only long for her lady and lament that Ukon had not chosen to enlighten them. Ukon for her part was loath to raise a stir, and Genji did not want gossip at this late date. Ukon could not even inquire after the child. And so the days went by bringing no light on the terrible mystery."
4,6,1,11,04060111,"    Genji longed for a glimpse of the dead girl, if only in a dream. On the day after the services he did have a fleeting dream of the woman who had appeared that fatal night. He concluded, and the thought filled him with horror, that he had attracted the attention of an evil spirit haunting the neglected villa."
4,7,1,1,04070101,"    Early in the Tenth Month the governor of iyo left for his post, taking the lady of the locust shell with him. Genji chose his farewell presents with great care. For the lady there were numerous fans,* and combs of beautiful workmanship, and pieces of cloth (she could see that he had had them dyed specially) for the wayside gods. He also returned her robe, ""the shell of the locust."""
4,7,1,2,04070102,"          ""A keepsake till we meet again, I had hoped,<br>         And see, my tears have rotted the sleeves away."""
4,7,1,3,04070103,"    There were other things too, but it would be tedious to describe them."
4,7,1,4,04070104, His messenger returned empty-handed. It was through her brother that she answered his poem.
4,7,1,5,04070105,"          ""Autumn comes, the wings of the locust are shed.<br>         A summer robe returns, and I weep aloud."""
4,7,1,6,04070106,"    She had remarkable singleness of purpose, whatever else she might have. It was the first day of winter. There were chilly showers, as if to mark the occasion and the skies were dark. He spent the day lost in thought."
4,7,1,7,04070107,"         ""The one has gone, to the other I say farewell.<br>         They go their unknown ways. The end of autumn."""
4,7,1,8,04070108,"    He knew how painful a secret love can be.<br>    I had hoped, out of deference to him, to conceal these difficult matters; but I have been accused of romancing, of pretending that because he was the son of an emperor he had no faults. Now, perhaps, I shall be accused of having revealed too much."
